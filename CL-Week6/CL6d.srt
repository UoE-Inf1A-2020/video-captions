1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,525
We now have this. Let's
try a few examples.

2
00:00:03,525 --> 00:00:06,195
What I want you to
do is to tell me,

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:08,535
now, here's a block.

4
00:00:08,535 --> 00:00:12,390
What's special about that block?

5
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,510
In other words, can we
describe that block?

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,460
Not by describing a state,

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,725
but remember which state
we said the values

8
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:23,505
of all of the predicates.

9
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:25,815
Now I'm asking you to tell me

10
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:30,029
what values are common
across these four.

11
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,355
Amber and green for that one.

12
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,240
Yup, Amber and green.

13
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,950
What about this one?

14
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,235
How many things you Usain?

15
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:46,805
Red and blue and green.

16
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:50,765
Here we have four
things in the block.

17
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:54,050
How many things do we expect
them to have in common?

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,850
Too good?

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,145
And what are the two for days?

20
00:00:58,145 --> 00:01:00,455
Now? Green and red.

21
00:01:00,455 --> 00:01:02,750
So you do this, you
should check that you

22
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,570
can do the same for the
other block shown here.

23
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,245
We'll put the solutions
online. What's a block?

24
00:01:09,245 --> 00:01:11,195
What makes something a block?

25
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:12,980
What do these have in common?

26
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,170
What happens if I draw this?

27
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,880
What do they have in common?

28
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,830
They know all the
things that are not

29
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:21,725
read has to be a power of two.

30
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:23,135
Let's just think about it.

31
00:01:23,135 --> 00:01:28,235
We've got our 16
different states.

32
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:31,340
When I say read,

33
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,410
I cut the number in half.

34
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,375
If I say not read,

35
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:37,175
I cut the number in half.

36
00:01:37,175 --> 00:01:40,670
Suppose I say red
and then I say blue.

37
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,070
I not only cut the
number of things

38
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,890
I'm considering in
half by saying blue,

39
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,250
I'm cutting the number of
red things in half as well

40
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,925
because these properties
are independent,

41
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,145
there is no connection
between the properties.

42
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:58,370
So when you say blue,
for any other thing,

43
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,020
you've counted all the things

44
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,820
that are red and not
green or something,

45
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,125
and you've got them there.

46
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,510
Half of them will be blue
and half of them won't,

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,625
because we've represented
everything here.

48
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:10,550
So every time you
add one of these,

49
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,335
we call them literals.

50
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:13,640
That is one of

51
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,180
your basic lattice or the
negation of a basic letter,

52
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,389
then you cut the
number of states into.

53
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:22,430
So we start from 16.

54
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,900
If we say one thing,

55
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,720
either red or not red
or amber or not Amber,

56
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,435
Just one thing carried
down to eight.

57
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:30,470
If we say two things,

58
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,685
we got it down to four

59
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,455
and we carry it down
to three things.

60
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:34,835
We cut it down to two.

61
00:02:34,835 --> 00:02:37,160
And actually we have
seen examples already.

62
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,630
We carry it down to four things.

63
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,905
We got a single state.

64
00:02:39,905 --> 00:02:42,260
And that's just
represented by saying

65
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,170
what's true and what's
false in that state.

66
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,405
If we go back to our example,

67
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:48,875
we were looking at

68
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,290
just this picture
and we were looking

69
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,065
at these being one
and these being one.

70
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:56,060
And basically if I put the thing

71
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,920
together, this is a block.

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,605
It's repeated again because
everything's repeated.

73
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:03,980
This count says, if you
do that repetition,

74
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,050
if we just fold
everything up, well,

75
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,625
it's difficult to physically,

76
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:11,405
but you can imagine doing it
physically in one direction.

77
00:03:11,405 --> 00:03:13,820
You just roll it up into a tube,

78
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,070
into a cylinder
that maps around on

79
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,510
itself to wrap it around

80
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,550
the other way you need
something better than paper.

81
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,020
Because if you're going
to make that match up,

82
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,000
you can't do the
cylinder trick again.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,740
Geometry doesn't work like that,

84
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,545
so you have to make it
into a torus this way,

85
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:29,450
the cylinders being
done that way to make

86
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:32,135
a row and then it's been
wrapped around into a torus.

87
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:34,190
So you can put these
things on there.

88
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,419
If you go to Wikipedia,

89
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:37,850
you will see that that's where
this picture comes from.

90
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,610
This one counts as a block.

91
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,785
And a Kansas not G,

92
00:03:42,785 --> 00:03:44,540
not or a block is

93
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,689
a rectangle of these
things on the torus.

94
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:52,160
A rectangle whose sides
are some power of two.

95
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,175
So it can be one which
is two to the 0,

96
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,350
or it can be two
or it can be for,

97
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,970
because we don't have
any more room on,

98
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,935
on this thing. That's
what they are.

99
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:04,775
There's a slightly more tricky
example of the same thing.

100
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:07,310
If we consider these
four corner things,

101
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,255
which is where we're
not green and blue.

102
00:04:11,255 --> 00:04:13,580
So not green means wherein

103
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,955
these columns not blue
means we're in these rows.

104
00:04:16,955 --> 00:04:19,580
So we end up with these
four corner things.

105
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,130
And that again forms a block
if it's wrapped round.
