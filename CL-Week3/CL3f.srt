1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
It's often helpful in situations

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:05,070
like an exam setting
where you can't just

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,950
pointed the Board appointed
the region to use

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,520
these codes to talk about
regions of the Venn diagram.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,980
These correspond to
the binary codes

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,500
we get by putting a, B, C,

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,715
a 0 or one,

8
00:00:17,715 --> 00:00:20,910
and taking this as a
three-digit binary number,

9
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,145
or three bit binary number.

10
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:27,495
So 0 is 000 where
no things are true.

11
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,600
Seven is 111 where
everything is true.

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,980
And one for instance,

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,460
is 001, where c is true.

14
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,715
For is 1-0-0, where a is true,

15
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,755
you can work out the rest
of them for yourself.

16
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:44,285
Now we're going to use
these. Another example.

17
00:00:44,285 --> 00:00:51,140
Here's our example.
B, C sum C is a.

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:57,935
Therefore, some a is not be no B,

19
00:00:57,935 --> 00:00:59,855
C. What does that mean?

20
00:00:59,855 --> 00:01:02,990
No, VC every B is not.

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,810
See, here's the brown one.

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,835
Every day he's not say.

23
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:09,725
So 37 are empty.

24
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:14,645
Everyone agree? Right? Some CSA.

25
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:16,910
Sum C is a,

26
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,680
so something in the blue is in a,

27
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,050
at least one of several m5

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,970
is inhabited, but we
don't know which one.

29
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:28,805
Here. We want to show that
the conclusion is valid.

30
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:32,765
So we've got both 37 are empty.

31
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:38,975
At least one of 75 is inhabited.

32
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:41,674
One of 75 is inhabited.

33
00:01:41,674 --> 00:01:43,160
37 are empty.

34
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,335
What can we deduce from that?

35
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:47,435
Five is inhabited.

36
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,550
And five is inhabited

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,890
means that at least
145 is inhabited,

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,095
which is what we need
for the conclusion.

39
00:01:57,095 --> 00:02:00,049
When we look at one
of these rules,

40
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:03,395
what we're trying to
do is to work out,

41
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,230
does it apply in every universe?

42
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,100
So if I give an argument
like this that says,

43
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,230
I know that 37 are empty,

44
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,900
I know that one of
75 is inhabited,

45
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,640
but because seven is empty,

46
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,455
that means five is inhabited.

47
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:22,355
That tells me that at
least 1045 is inhabited.

48
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,745
That argument shows
that the rule is sized.

49
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:29,990
Rule is sound if in every model,

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:35,600
when its premises are valid
and its conclusion is valid.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,480
So if we want to
show it's not sound,

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,885
we find a model in which
the premises are valid,

53
00:02:41,885 --> 00:02:43,835
but the conclusion isn't valid.

54
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:46,700
And if you want to find
those counterexamples,

55
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,575
what we just did is
a good way to do it.

56
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:50,615
You try and make the proof
and then you find now it

57
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:51,710
doesn't work because I

58
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,030
can put things here,
here and here.

59
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,055
The mean, the proof doesn't work.

60
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,910
Now, I am going to leave
you with the task of using

61
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,450
that method to give a
proof that this example,

62
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,180
which we looked at
earlier is not sound.
