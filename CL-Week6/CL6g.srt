1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,715
So far we've been
looking at logs of ones.

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:04,590
What happens if we

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,230
have a block of zeros?
What does that mean?

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,700
This, if it were ones,

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,040
would be blue and
green cells saying it.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,320
Zara was saying we're not there,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,185
we're outside the places
where Hulu and greener.

8
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:20,535
So what's not blue and
green by De Morgan?

9
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:24,520
It's not blue or green.

10
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,490
Not green is out here.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,320
Not blue is out there.

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,605
And we make these true
if either of those,

13
00:00:33,605 --> 00:00:35,315
that's what the O means.

14
00:00:35,315 --> 00:00:39,095
All the things here and
all the things there.

15
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,850
Instead of intersecting as

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,500
we did when we had an end here,

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,820
now we've got an ore,

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,805
so the ones go together.

19
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:48,485
You've already seen

20
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:51,305
a Disjunctive Normal
Form for this example.

21
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:53,030
Now we're going to take it and

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,250
produce a conjunctive
normal form.

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,950
The disjunctive normal form is

24
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,500
easier to think about
and easier to read off.

25
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,105
Cnf is more important.

26
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:06,184
So for CNF, we could do
identify blocks of zeros.

27
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:08,480
People find different
ways of doing this.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,420
The way I normally do it
is I think what would it

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,840
be to say that if
I had ones here,

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,530
which would be that
I have not a not g

31
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:21,770
and not a not G

32
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,205
gives me that column and
puts me in these two rows.

33
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:26,660
And then I need to negate that.

34
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,970
So I say a orgy,

35
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,770
I change the ends to
know a or G or not.

36
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,130
So you have to change
the zeros to positive.

37
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,750
So I say a or G,

38
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,825
That means we are
somewhere in this pit.

39
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:44,000
Or, and I change

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,760
those and it's not us away
somewhere in this pit.

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,490
So I've excluded all
of that by my a or

42
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,135
G and all of that by
my half from here.

43
00:01:53,135 --> 00:01:55,655
So I'm saying I'm outside here.

44
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,010
I'm either here or I'm here.

45
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,990
That's the O and M will deal with

46
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:02,240
the other bits will
say we're not in here.

47
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,270
So what these two got in common,

48
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,934
they certainly both Not a and G,

49
00:02:09,934 --> 00:02:13,295
and they're certainly both not b.

50
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:14,720
But now we've got to do

51
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,060
our thinking backwards to
our standing on our head.

52
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,195
How would you like to think
about it and say what we say?

53
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:25,835
We say either a holds
or gee doesn't hold,

54
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,475
or b holds. Try the last one.

55
00:02:28,475 --> 00:02:30,380
Try writing it down for
yourselves and then we'll

56
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,435
see whether you get it
right on the next slide.

57
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:34,700
Now, there are various notations.

58
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,350
Some paper will have seen things

59
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,180
like this in Engineering before.

60
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,715
So instead of writing
things as we normally write

61
00:02:40,715 --> 00:02:43,595
them in this
mathematical notation,

62
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:46,114
or we sometimes write
them in Haskell.

63
00:02:46,114 --> 00:02:47,840
Some people use things like this.

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
They may put bars over

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,650
the things domain negations
rather than primes.

66
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:53,270
There are lots of
ways of doing it.

67
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:56,150
If you use a different
notation, that's fine,

68
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,380
as long as you are
very clear what

69
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,970
you use and you get it right,

70
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,635
we should be able to
give it mounts for it.

71
00:03:00,635 --> 00:03:03,065
I will normally be
using this notation.

72
00:03:03,065 --> 00:03:04,475
What was this last one?

73
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,960
If we're not in here,

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,400
then we're either in

75
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,025
or we're in not a, does
everyone get that?

76
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,410
Given any packing,
you can now do this.

77
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,090
What happens if I
get an isolated?

78
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,040
What happens if I
had a 0 right there?

79
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,990
What would I hadn't
I describe this is

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:20,344
something which is amber,

81
00:03:20,344 --> 00:03:23,225
not green, red, no, blue.

82
00:03:23,225 --> 00:03:25,040
If I want to say I'm not there,

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,515
I have to say at least
one of those must fail.

84
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:32,585
So I'd say not amber or
green or not red or blue.

85
00:03:32,585 --> 00:03:34,670
A block widow, an element
is still a block.

86
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,110
It's a power of two,

87
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,360
and the power of two is
the zeroeth power of two.

88
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,165
You may have many
blocks of size one.

89
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:42,620
Then if you're doing,

90
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:44,420
if you're doing clocks of 1s,

91
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,580
than you would have
many disjunct in

92
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,200
your DNF because you'd be

93
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,910
saying either way
here, over here,

94
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,620
over here, or you'd have

95
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:56,285
a remaining conjuncts in your
cnf if these were zeros,

96
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:59,765
Let's say we are not here
and not here and not here.

97
00:03:59,765 --> 00:04:03,620
We could do things by
taking very small blocks.

98
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,740
We could always focus down
on single elements and say,

99
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,705
those are the blocks
we're thinking about.

100
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:12,170
For we get much more writing
down because we'd say,

101
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,810
let's do the disjunctive
when we'd say way here,

102
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,220
over here, over here,

103
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,435
over here, over here,

104
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:21,050
we'd write down lots of
descriptions of State since I,

105
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,395
one of those holes were looking
for compact descriptions.

106
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:25,625
So we're always looking for

107
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:28,730
bigger blocks rather
than smaller blocks.

108
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,890
But I do have to be
passive to self.

109
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,750
There are three things in a row,

110
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,580
then you need two blocks up to,

111
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,050
to cover those three things.
