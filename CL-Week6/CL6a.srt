1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:03,030
We have a universe
with predicate.

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:04,500
There could be
anything in the world.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,075
They can be as big
as we like today.

4
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:07,320
We got to realize that

5
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,600
because we have a
restricted language,

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,010
we really don't need to talk

7
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,615
about everything in the world.

8
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:13,815
And in fact, when we have a

9
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,540
propositional logic and we use

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,030
some number of
propositional letters

11
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:19,140
to talk about things.

12
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,150
You know, we have
predicates a, B,

13
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,835
and C, which we could
interpret in the world.

14
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,040
There's one model which
covers everything.

15
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,735
So we actually can
look at one universe,

16
00:00:28,735 --> 00:00:30,905
what goes on in that universe.

17
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:32,180
And once we understand that,

18
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,755
we understand every other one,

19
00:00:33,755 --> 00:00:35,900
there's a universe which I
showed you at the end of

20
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,435
last time with just
four predicates.

21
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:42,470
And the only possibilities
for things in this language,

22
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,840
the only things we can talk
about is the differences in

23
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,195
whether they have the
property Ohio town,

24
00:00:47,195 --> 00:00:49,805
whether they have the property
P or don't, and so on.

25
00:00:49,805 --> 00:00:53,150
Which means that there are
only 16 possibilities.

26
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,085
And if we take this principle

27
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:57,995
saying if things
can't be distinguish,

28
00:00:57,995 --> 00:00:59,960
them will treat them as equal.

29
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,860
Then basically the only
difference between universes for

30
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,794
this language with four letters

31
00:01:05,794 --> 00:01:08,450
is do they have
something of this kind?

32
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,445
Let's say that I have
something that is

33
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,980
a and not B and Nazi and not the,

34
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,540
or do they not have
anything like that?

35
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,540
Instead of considering
all possible universes,

36
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,765
we can just consider universes
that are sub universes

37
00:01:20,765 --> 00:01:24,290
of this one that has
16 different things.

38
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,270
Because if I had any
other universe I

39
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,160
could map it onto
here by saying, well,

40
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,130
I'll just clump all
the things that are a,

41
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,000
not B, not C and D
clump those together.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,590
Interesting, yes,
there is one of them,

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,725
or in some other instances
maybe there isn't.

44
00:01:39,725 --> 00:01:42,410
So how many sub universes are

45
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,214
there of that
particular universe?

46
00:01:45,214 --> 00:01:47,375
64. You think?

47
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:49,370
How many different things we got?

48
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,280
16. So how do we
calculate the answer?

49
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,590
There were 16 things here.

50
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,225
If I take a sub universe,

51
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:58,880
each one could either
be there or not there.

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,325
So how many sub
universes are that?

53
00:02:01,325 --> 00:02:02,735
There are a huge number,

54
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:06,155
two to the 60 is 64 thousand.

55
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:09,620
And we're going to focus
mainly on this example.

56
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,210
The ways we deal with it will

57
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:14,420
generalize to much
bigger examples.

58
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,944
But already here we've
got 64 thousand,

59
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:20,030
and that's a binary thousand,

60
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,410
which is 10 to four.

61
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,055
So 64 kbps bit or KB Things.

62
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:28,730
There are 256 universities
that we have three things,

63
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,675
but it goes up to the 64 K
when we have four things.

64
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:37,790
And as you say, it's
65,536 to be precise,

65
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,800
what we're going to
say is that if we

66
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,690
take this one or

67
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,685
this one and this is
the one we'll look at.

68
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:45,140
If you're given any one of

69
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,125
the 65 thousand
anode patterns here,

70
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,945
you will be able to write
down a formula that

71
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,290
corresponds to that pattern
and as over 64 thousand.

72
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,730
And yet you'll be
able to do all of

73
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,380
them here just for fun,

74
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,745
are 256 Venn diagrams
with three things.

75
00:03:01,745 --> 00:03:03,485
They just randomly generated.

76
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:06,859
They do repeat a bit
which ones are missing?

77
00:03:06,859 --> 00:03:09,605
It's really odd already
when you've got three,

78
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:11,690
I wouldn't even try and
draw the picture of

79
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,970
the 64 thousand
because if we did,

80
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,710
it will be so small
you wouldn't see it.
