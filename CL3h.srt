1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
Boolean operations.

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:05,190
This tells us how
the operations work.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,740
So we have truth tables

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,890
for how the operations
work on the Booleans.

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,425
And I just want to say something

6
00:00:13,425 --> 00:00:17,700
about what happens in Haskell.

7
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,715
When we'd look at
the documentation,

8
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:25,410
it says infix x3 and infix to.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,620
Or what that means is that when I

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,879
write false and true or true,

11
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,760
it means one of these
two computations.

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,120
Either it means I take
these truths and do the OH,

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,500
and then at the end.

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,605
Or I take these two due the end,

15
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:47,210
an entity or in other words,

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,215
we either put brackets
here or brackets here.

17
00:00:51,215 --> 00:00:55,505
There are a lot of ideas here
which we will come back to.

18
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:58,970
The most important idea
is that when I write

19
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,455
something like false
and true or true,

20
00:01:03,455 --> 00:01:07,040
you should never think of it
as just a string of symbols.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,620
You should think of it
as a tree like this

22
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,990
that tells you what to
do with these values,

23
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,130
to put them together,

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,330
what to do with this,

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,620
and how to put them together.

26
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,830
So that diagram is
what we really want

27
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:22,265
to think about when we
think about an expression.

28
00:01:22,265 --> 00:01:24,890
And the other thing is, That's

29
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,365
actually a very simple
form of computation.

30
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:31,950
This is a different
computation from that one.

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,500
This one comes out false,

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,000
that one comes out true.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,400
So we can use Haskell to
tell us what's going on.

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,570
And we can try doing this
without the brackets.

35
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,610
We get true doing it
with the brackets.

36
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,960
One way we get false doing it

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,445
with brackets the
other way we get true.

38
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,800
So this is the way that it's red.

39
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,220
I'm going to leave you there.

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,720
Thanks very much indeed,

41
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,270
and I will see you tomorrow
at a slightly later era.
