1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,775
Here's an example where
that's more difficult.

2
00:00:02,775 --> 00:00:04,050
So if we just look at

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,244
that formula at the
top and say, okay,

4
00:00:07,244 --> 00:00:12,090
we've got a Universe
with 256 individuals,

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,090
eight letters, 256 individuals.

6
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,710
I want to count how many of

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,475
those individuals
actually satisfy this.

8
00:00:20,475 --> 00:00:22,245
That's what we're
trying to work out.

9
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:25,155
From a formula. You
can draw a diagram.

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,370
You have to think a little bit to

11
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,690
make it look moderately.

12
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,970
Any errors trying
to point upwards,

13
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,440
because it's helpful to do that.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,800
The formulae will give you
to do this exercise with,

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,255
will be pretty easy to draw

16
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:38,685
the translation from
what's at the top.

17
00:00:38,685 --> 00:00:41,020
Not B implies, not a implies ie.

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,995
Cheque it, but I'm
pretty sure I've got

19
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:45,380
the right formula
for this diagram.

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,970
And if I haven't worked with

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,475
the diagram rather than
the formula here again,

22
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,710
I've got something where we

23
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,630
don't have anything
with its negation.

24
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,870
First thing to note here is that

25
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,500
the formula only mentioned
seven of the letters.

26
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,680
So that means that
whatever answer I get,

27
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,050
I'll effectively have
to multiply it by two

28
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,095
because the letter H isn't used.

29
00:01:09,095 --> 00:01:11,150
So whatever answers I get

30
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,655
that talk about the
letters from a to G,

31
00:01:13,655 --> 00:01:15,335
b two possibilities
and we can make

32
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:17,210
H true or we can make H falls.

33
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,365
So we're now going to count

34
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:22,910
the number possibilities
for those seven atoms.

35
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,995
And we'll do it the
way we did before.

36
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:26,315
We can start from the left.

37
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,400
You could start from the
right if you really are one

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,755
of the people who wants to
read from right to left,

39
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,090
and that's better for you.

40
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,620
You could start
thinking coming in

41
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,480
here and putting the
numbers on that side,

42
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,460
but I'll do them
here to start with,

43
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,540
and then we'll cheque and see

44
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,680
if they give the same answer.

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,030
So one way of getting in there,

46
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,500
one way of getting in the way of

47
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,465
getting in the way
of getting in that,

48
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:46,670
one way of getting
in this region.

49
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,755
How many ways are there
of getting into it?

50
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:51,770
Three. And this region,

51
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:54,635
how many ways are there
of getting into it?

52
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:57,620
That three goes on
those two things.

53
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,630
So how many ways are
there of getting

54
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,985
into this region here?

55
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,805
77 ways of getting in.

56
00:02:04,805 --> 00:02:08,765
How many ways of getting out 777?

57
00:02:08,765 --> 00:02:11,790
So how many
evaluations do we get?

58
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,270
We can go across the
bottom here, that's one.

59
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,180
We can come through here somehow.

60
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,120
But there were seven
ways of getting in here.

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,730
And for each of those seven ways,

62
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,110
there are three ways
of getting out.

63
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,795
So we got those three
sevens plus one

64
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:39,505
is and let me do that.

65
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:41,725
44 of the 256,

66
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,090
it would not be fun to

67
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,935
try and do that with
the truth table,

68
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:46,900
where it's doing it like
this gets to be quite

69
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,985
fun because you suddenly realise,

70
00:02:48,985 --> 00:02:50,575
gosh, I've mastered the universe.

71
00:02:50,575 --> 00:02:52,240
So that's counting the ways of

72
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,310
threading a path
from left to right.

73
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,605
If you have a non planar graph,

74
00:02:56,605 --> 00:03:01,885
what you should do
is try and simplify.

75
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:04,915
And one way we know
of simplifying

76
00:03:04,915 --> 00:03:09,010
problems about logic
clauses is to say, well,

77
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,520
we can at least make it
simpler by considering

78
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,330
the cases where a is true and
the cases where a is false.

79
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,310
Typically if you
do that once on a,

80
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,130
on a non planar graph,

81
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,920
you get to planar graphs and

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,170
those two out and
add it together.

83
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:27,260
So it's the same sorts of
tools as we used before.

84
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,920
Same tools we use in the
PLL simplify the problem

85
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,595
into a simpler set of courses
because I take a true,

86
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,380
simpler set of clauses
because I take a

87
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,990
false and then add those
two results together.

88
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,230
I always find it
shocking that this works

89
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,480
both ways here we've
done this some we've

90
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,880
come up 22 times two.

91
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,355
If we work from right to left,

92
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,605
we label these ones with ones.

93
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:53,660
So there are three ways
of getting in here.

94
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,655
So we label those two, threes.

95
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:58,095
So there are six ways
of getting out here.

96
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:00,740
Three ways of getting
out here, one way here,

97
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,985
and it has to,

98
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,860
but it's a really weird fact,

99
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,510
is add up the same amount.

100
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:12,185
So this is a fact of geometry,
logic and arithmetic,

101
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,540
approaching a planar graph from

102
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:17,570
the left or the right
and doing this counting,

103
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,785
you get the same result.

104
00:04:18,785 --> 00:04:20,765
Whichever way you
count gets good.

105
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,250
Fact, because if you didn't,

106
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,370
the universe would fall to
pieces as in 0 equals one.
