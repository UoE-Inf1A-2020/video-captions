1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,715
So far we've been
looking at logs of ones.

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:04,590
What happens if we

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:07,245
have a block of zeros?
What does that mean?

4
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:08,700
This, if it were ones,

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,040
would be blue and
green cells saying it.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,320
Zara was saying we're not there,

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,185
we're outside the places
where Hulu and greener.

8
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:20,550
So what's not blue and
green by De Morgan?

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,580
It's not blue or not green.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,425
Not grain is out here.

11
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,315
Not blue is out there.

12
00:00:30,315 --> 00:00:33,600
And we make these true
if either of those,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,260
that's what the O means.

14
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,095
All the things here and
all the things there.

15
00:00:39,095 --> 00:00:40,850
Instead of intersecting as

16
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,500
we did when we had an end here.

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,015
Now we've got an all
the ones go together.

18
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,490
We've already looked at getting

19
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:53,315
Disjunctive Normal Forms
from blocks, ones.

20
00:00:53,315 --> 00:00:57,185
I'm afraid it's much more
useful to play with the zeros.

21
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:58,910
So once more you have to get

22
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,680
negation in your head working,

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,790
you're getting quite a lot of

24
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:03,350
practice thinking backwards.

25
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:05,090
Hopefully, it's getting easier.

26
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,535
If we now focus on the zeros.

27
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:09,935
Then for this one, the expression

28
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:11,540
that we're thinking of is

29
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,560
if we're not in here
than either way in here,

30
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,069
which is not nowhere in here,

31
00:01:19,069 --> 00:01:22,700
which is a not ROA.

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,715
If we're not in here than
either, we're in this pit,

33
00:01:25,715 --> 00:01:29,870
which is not a over in this pit,

34
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,990
which is R naught a OR a.

35
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,735
Now, if we say
we're outside here,

36
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:37,490
which means we're either they're

37
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:39,410
all there and we're outside here,

38
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,540
which means with
arrow that we and

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,300
those together to say we're
outside both of them.

40
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:48,110
And that means that the ones
are represented by this.

41
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:51,800
This is called a conjunctive
normal form because it is

42
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,640
a conjunction of
disjunction literals.

43
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,340
If we take any pattern
of zeros and ones in

44
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,565
here and then identify
the blocks of zeros.

45
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:03,425
We can do something like this.

46
00:02:03,425 --> 00:02:07,100
Represent each block of
zeros as a disjunction,

47
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,530
then conjoin all
of those and we'll

48
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,740
have written down something
equivalent to that pattern.

49
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,405
You've already seen

50
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:17,225
a Disjunctive Normal
Form for this example.

51
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:18,740
Now we're going to take it,

52
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,170
produce a conjunctive
normal form.

53
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,870
The disjunctive normal form is

54
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:26,450
easier to think about
and easier to read off.

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,600
But the conjunctive normal
form is more useful.

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,020
If you think about the
disjunctive normal form,

57
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,780
it says, we've got
some things like this.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,800
And we've got some
things like this.

59
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,840
And we've got some
things like this.

60
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,970
It just tells you
there are things of

61
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,670
this form because we're saying
this and this and this,

62
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,655
or this and this and this. O, ok.

63
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:52,790
So in general, you
probably have to

64
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,500
get very deep descriptions

65
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,330
of lots of things
to say that there.

66
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:00,110
Whereas the conjunctive
normal form says,

67
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:03,380
we don't have things
like something.

68
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,225
It says we're away from here.

69
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:08,060
And when we're writing
specifications of programs,

70
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,040
for instance, we don't
say this can happen,

71
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,675
all this can happen
or this can happen.

72
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:14,390
Typically, we say this will never

73
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,040
happen when you say a small thing

74
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,315
that should never happen,

75
00:03:17,315 --> 00:03:19,490
another small thing that
should never happen.

76
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,155
Things arise more often.

77
00:03:21,155 --> 00:03:23,900
And that our natural way
of describing problem,

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,360
but we're going to
talk about Sudoku as

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,500
an example of a problem
that we can code in logic.

80
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,650
And now's a good time to
talk about it a little bit.

81
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,350
If we think of a Sudoku
board and you start

82
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,530
filling it in and
suddenly you see that.

83
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,180
Now I'd have to put a nine

84
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,845
here and I've already
got a nine in that row.

85
00:03:42,845 --> 00:03:44,630
I can't do it because you can't

86
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,985
have two nines in the same row.

87
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:49,790
Ok, so we are saying
that can't happen.

88
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,470
Then we'd say, Oh, you can't

89
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,610
have two weights in the same row.

90
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,010
We want to have the same
things in the same row.

91
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,635
There are lots of little
things that will say.

92
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:01,444
And what we're trying to do
is to then solve the problem.

93
00:04:01,444 --> 00:04:04,670
Finding something that satisfies

94
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,410
all those requirements
that doesn't

95
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,140
make a 99 in the same row,

96
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,550
so we're not allowed
to do things.

97
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,560
And that's common
in many problems.

98
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,825
We're saying you're not
allowed to do this.

99
00:04:14,825 --> 00:04:17,105
And that means that the
conjunctive normal form

100
00:04:17,105 --> 00:04:18,800
is easier because we're

101
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,150
saying we're not
allowed to do this.

102
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,205
Otherwise, you produce
things other than this,

103
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:24,545
and you've got to do
things other than this,

104
00:04:24,545 --> 00:04:26,645
and you've got to do
things other than that.

105
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:29,165
And you exclude all
sorts of possibilities.

106
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,725
And then you try and find

107
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:33,395
something that satisfies
all those constraints.

108
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:36,600
That's why cnf is more important.
