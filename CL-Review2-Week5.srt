00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,640
Good morning. Made this later.

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:14,850
Going to start by reviewing

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,740
very briefly some of the
material on syllogisms.

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,450
The important point is to
get across the idea of

5
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,340
a proposition because
that's what we

6
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,190
generalize to make a sequence.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,070
So we start from
Aristotle's propositions

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,520
and move on to sequence,

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
which were introduced by Jensen.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,525
But we start very simply,

11
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:44,000
we have a universe of

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,335
things and we have

13
00:00:48,335 --> 00:00:51,200
some collections of things
with particular properties.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,820
So here are the
collection of things

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,800
that satisfy the property

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,230
a for any thing in the
universe, let's say x.

17
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:04,175
Then this is the set of things
such that a holds of X.

18
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:07,625
We represent a as a function.

19
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:10,820
So a of x is a Boolean
value, true or false.

20
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,410
And this is the set of things
such that a of X is true.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:19,040
Set of X, such that

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,965
a holes of x is what I've
drawn a diagram off here.

23
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,545
And we're interested
in the relationship

24
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,785
between different predicates.

25
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:33,500
So for example,
here's a predicate.

26
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,700
Another one, be than I've

27
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,500
drawn the set of things such that

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,229
b holds of X name this diagram.

29
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:45,740
Everything that's in a is in B.

30
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,040
And I'm going to write that
in a symbolic notation.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,655
As a satisfies B,

32
00:01:52,655 --> 00:01:56,945
which I say as all a are B.

33
00:01:56,945 --> 00:01:59,090
We then take another example,

34
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,155
and this time, Let's say
this is a, this is b.

35
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,110
And here is the case
that no a, a, B,

36
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,845
every a is contained in
the complement of B,

37
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:15,620
every a is not v. And we
use this symbol for naught.

38
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,660
If I take something in a and it

39
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,820
doesn't satisfy B for every x in

40
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,115
a b if x is false, now, a hobby.

41
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:27,860
Now look at that. This
is completely symmetric.

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,515
So this tells us our
first logical rule.

43
00:02:30,515 --> 00:02:32,600
If every a is NOT B,

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,480
then it's the same
as every B is not a.
