1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,240
Now we're going to
do the same thing

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,620
for things. On the right.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,395
We have the laws about not,

4
00:00:07,395 --> 00:00:10,080
which say that a satisfies

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,710
the comedy if and only if a and

6
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,500
not the satisfies P. So we

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,714
take effectively the
diagram we had before.

8
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,470
But this time we're saying we're

9
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,140
focusing on the things
that don't satisfy

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,920
D. So this corresponds

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,200
to looking at things
which don't satisfy dy.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,345
Doing that with a delta here.

13
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:44,030
To bring that delta
over here first,

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,560
we need to make all of

15
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,855
the deltas to make
it into one thing,

16
00:00:47,855 --> 00:00:49,250
then we can bring it over here.

17
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,670
So that's not all delta.

18
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:55,385
What does it mean to
say not all delta?

19
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:56,720
I gave you three property.

20
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,560
It's not big or Reg
what does that mean?

21
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,680
It's not big and it's not red.

22
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,540
So to say that some
things in this is to

23
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:14,465
say every single one of the
properties in delta is false.

24
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,430
Something that's here. If any of

25
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,125
the properties in delta true,

26
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,390
it would be over here
because then we'd have,

27
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,680
yes, it's true for one of them.

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,095
So it's true for the
or of all of them.

29
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,660
So that takes us to,

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,210
if we have a delta on the right,

31
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,670
then this is valid in you.

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,530
If this is valid in

33
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,150
the universe of all
those things for which

34
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,945
everybody in delta is false.

35
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,670
And then of course
we're going to put

36
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:43,040
those two pictures together.

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,920
So here's the picture for
where every G is true.

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:55,200
Here's the picture for where
every day in delta is false.

39
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:01,750
And I can take the things
where every G is true,

40
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,505
that keeps me above
the green line,

41
00:02:03,505 --> 00:02:05,950
where every day is false that

42
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,665
B brings me below the red line.

43
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:12,320
And that means that I'm looking
at this pit that's left.

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,110
This is the only one of

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,665
those few slides that
you need to remember.

46
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:24,085
This is the end point
of this little story.

47
00:02:24,085 --> 00:02:26,920
It says that if I look at

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,100
one of these sequence
and a satisfies B,

49
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,230
which we're very familiar
with the extended

50
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,870
by putting a gamma
and adults are there.

51
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,825
How should we understand or
how can we understand it?

52
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:42,110
Because by choosing
different a's and b's,

53
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,730
we can always put things
in different orders.

54
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,630
So we could choose a different
day out of gamma and put

55
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,890
this one back or different
B out of delta is one back.

56
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,680
We choose an i and v. And then we

57
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,770
can say what we want
to know now is,

58
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,480
is a satisfies P valid in

59
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,505
the universe are those
things for which

60
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:07,370
every G and gamma is true.

61
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,520
And everyday in delta is false.

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,280
So that's a way of reading
it and putting it back

63
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
to something that's just
talking about every ISP,

64
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,360
which we can understand
more easily.
