1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
This is Phil slide on sections.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,010
It works for things like
greater than because they

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,350
are just functions from
two things to bool.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,955
So it's just like the ones
we've been talking about.

5
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:11,895
This is the property of
being greater than 0.

6
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:15,345
This is the function
multiplied by two.

7
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:17,520
This is the function at one.

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,520
This is the function take
two to the power of me.

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,900
So it's the function of n,

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,670
gives you two to the power n. And

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:26,880
this is the function square
that we wrote earlier.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,485
So these two are very different.

13
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:30,840
But in the two times o plus one,

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,165
we could have swapped those
around because there,

15
00:00:33,165 --> 00:00:35,370
because they want, what's
the name of what they are?

16
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,825
Commutative operations.

17
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:40,340
Commutative, probably useful
to your sections in logic.

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,875
But now we want something
a little more flexible.

19
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,840
This is to show why
what we have so

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,420
far isn't quite flexible enough.

21
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,870
I want to now try
somebody loves everybody,

22
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,270
and everybody loves somebody
at least I'll try one of

23
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,970
them and leave you to
worry about the other one.

24
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,400
So if I say everybody,

25
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,875
Mary loves, that means
Mary loves everybody.

26
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:03,815
So 7x instead of Mary loves,

27
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,940
i do an x. I can say x loves
everybody, loves everybody.

28
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,210
X, if everybody loves,

29
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:13,850
right, I've just put
x in the set of Mary.

30
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,415
And then I say, somebody
loves everybody,

31
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:19,835
is, some body has the
property, loves everybody.

32
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:22,460
It's already with a
tiny simple example,

33
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,980
getting a bit unwieldy
and we're having to use

34
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,630
really long names to

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,370
explain to ourselves
what we're doing.

36
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,945
And it's not the way to do this.

37
00:01:29,945 --> 00:01:33,485
The way to do this
is to use lambda.

38
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:35,810
You fill were here, he'd
be jumping sky high.

39
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,250
You'd be doing all
sorts of dances.

40
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,295
I don't quite down site feel
Lander is really important

41
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:41,750
and I'm so glad I get to

42
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,370
introduce it to you
before he does.

43
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,990
Lambda will introduce just with

44
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,300
some ordinary
mathematical kind of

45
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,590
examples and then
we'll take it back

46
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,015
to use it in the logic again,

47
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:54,875
the function square takes an
x and gives you x times x.

48
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,120
But I can also write

49
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,150
it whenever I have a function
definition like this,

50
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,060
function definition
has identifier

51
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,294
for the beginning a variable.

52
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:05,900
Let's just have a
variable and then

53
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,700
an expression with that variable.

54
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,860
So here I've got the identifier,

55
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,560
but I don't put variable
right after it.

56
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,870
I say this and the way I read
that backstroke is lambda.

57
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,750
That's because it looks like
the long bit of the lambda.

58
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,405
And since keyboards
don't have lambdas,

59
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:28,145
it was decided to use that
backstroke for lambda.

60
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:30,965
So this would be the
mathematical notation for this,

61
00:02:30,965 --> 00:02:32,450
which had a, did introduce in

62
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,800
one of her talks to some of you.

63
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,890
I think this is the same
function as we defined here.

64
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,190
But instead of giving a
name to x on this side,

65
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,560
the name for X is bound up in

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,085
this expression and it's only
available within brackets.

67
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,735
If I used x again,

68
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,535
outside, it will
be a different x.

69
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:52,235
If I already had an x
being used outside,

70
00:02:52,235 --> 00:02:53,990
this one would have
right in here,

71
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,160
x means this one.

72
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,130
Then I could write hypotenuse AB

73
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,510
is the square root of the square

74
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,100
of a plus the square root 2pi.

75
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,640
But I could also have
two parameters here,

76
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,680
lambda AB, square root,

77
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,765
square a, square b. That's fine.

78
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,685
So this enables us,

79
00:03:10,685 --> 00:03:12,920
instead of creating
long functions

80
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,810
with very long names,
do what they do.

81
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,370
You can just make the function

82
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,870
without creating a name for it.

83
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,745
And it's much, much clearer.

84
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:21,455
Once you get used
to reading them.

85
00:03:21,455 --> 00:03:25,130
So we know loves Mary
of x is x loves Mary.

86
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,485
So we use a lambda to write that.

87
00:03:27,485 --> 00:03:30,680
Then loves Mary is just lambda x,

88
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,090
arrow x loves Mary.

89
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,410
So when I want to write,

90
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:38,735
somebody loves Mary, I
could say some body.

91
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:41,480
And then lambda x, x loves Mary,

92
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,345
because we know this
maids loves Mary.

93
00:03:44,345 --> 00:03:47,270
And if I write it
in Maths than that,

94
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,400
there is something in

95
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,445
body which I'm thinking of
a sunset now not Lisbon,

96
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:54,530
such that x loves Mary.

97
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:57,410
Similarly, if I want to do
mock gloves, why? That's fine.

98
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:01,520
But we can also say mark loves
is lambda Y. Mark loves.

99
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,705
Why? When I say everybody loves,

100
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:10,580
i can say everybody lambda y, y.

101
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,830
This gets a bit easier to work

102
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,915
with because I can see the every,

103
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:16,670
every body, let's call it

104
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,085
y has the property that loves Y.

105
00:04:19,085 --> 00:04:21,575
As we read this, somebody,

106
00:04:21,575 --> 00:04:25,550
let's call it x has the
property that x loves Harry.

107
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,765
So now let's try.

108
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:30,560
Everybody loves
somebody, everybody,

109
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,100
let's call it x has the
property that somebody,

110
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,350
let's call it y. X loves y.

111
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,090
All of a sudden, we get

112
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,625
rid of all that
stuff on the other.

113
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,800
All these long things.

114
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,510
Just by saying this,

115
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,820
everybody call it x

116
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,130
and then we don't worry
about these properties,

117
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,510
um, how it looks after itself.

118
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,180
We've just written it down
and it actually works.

119
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,349
So this is for all
x there exists,

120
00:04:57,349 --> 00:04:59,240
or there should be
a y here, sorry,

121
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,675
that should be y, the x.

122
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:06,290
For all x there is a
y such as x loves y.

123
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,750
For all x, there is a y, yes,

124
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,720
that should be a wider
what I would like you to

125
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,350
do is to try and work out
what these three main.

126
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,940
So I want you to translate them

127
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,070
back into your natural language,

128
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,300
your mother language,
because it's,

129
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,535
it's hard enough to
one's natural tongue,

130
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,425
let alone during in
a foreign language.

131
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,420
What does exercise to main?

132
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,700
Let's go back to 11 means.

133
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,530
If we just think of EU law

134
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,210
being the bodies
we're talking about,

135
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,470
then it would mean that

136
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,130
everyone here loves somebody
hearing copy themselves.

137
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,585
We haven't said It's
not themselves.

138
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,040
So it could be that
just love themselves.

139
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,205
So it might even be true,
everybody here loves somebody.

140
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,695
In example two, we take

141
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:47,450
somebody you have to do

142
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:49,340
is choose that body
before we go on.

143
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,690
So we choose that body,

144
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,634
then they have the property
that they love everybody.

145
00:05:54,634 --> 00:05:57,230
There is somebody here who

146
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,735
loves everybody, has
very good of you.

147
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:02,015
Whoever you are. Example three,

148
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,130
there is somebody here.

149
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,070
What does this say? Who
is loved by everybody?

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,415
And the final one, every body.

151
00:06:10,415 --> 00:06:12,245
This is we, what does it mean?

152
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:15,815
Everybody, you as someone
who loves them, the good.

153
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:19,460
Saying those for different
things in English is

154
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,750
actually quite difficult in

155
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,210
every natural language
I know anything about.

156
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,500
It's quite difficult to make

157
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,860
those four distinction step
very important distinctions

158
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,315
when you're doing mathematics,

159
00:06:29,315 --> 00:06:30,680
when you're doing computing, and

160
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,990
also in your love life too.

161
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,520
But that's not the point.

162
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,415
So it's really useful

163
00:06:37,415 --> 00:06:39,950
to have this unwinding
at the moment.

164
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,540
It may seem, my god,

165
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,040
you've taken something simple,

166
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,720
like everybody lost somebody and

167
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,805
made it into these horrible
lambdas and stuff.

168
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,635
But actually, you will find,

169
00:06:48,635 --> 00:06:49,880
particularly if
you're thinking about

170
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,800
things in maths, arguments,

171
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,210
you find where they
save everything,

172
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,550
this integral, you get mixed up.

173
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,080
Try and analyze it in

174
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,960
these ways and these
mathematical notations,

175
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,455
the furrows and exists
if I got it right,

176
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:07,055
which that should be a y really
do help to make it clear.

177
00:07:07,055 --> 00:07:10,010
This is why when you
read a paper and

178
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:11,240
increasingly when you read

179
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,505
your course notes
through your time here,

180
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,860
am I trying to say
something like this?

181
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,200
We will normally
put it into words,

182
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,320
will more likely put
it into a mixture of

183
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,940
words in mathematical symbols

184
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,800
because we can be more
precise that way.
