1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:06,570
In this video, we're
going to continue looking

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,590
at syllogisms using
Venn diagrams.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,185
At the end of the last video,

4
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:16,900
we introduced two Venn diagrams.

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,075
And I left you with
the following problem.

6
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:25,230
These Venn diagrams represent

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,830
statements about the universe.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,920
So this one represents
the statement that there

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,950
are no things of this
type in this gray area.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:45,980
That is, that every a is b.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,360
In other words, anything
that's in a cannot be here,

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,145
so must be in B.

13
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:54,650
Then for every a is b,

14
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,670
this diagram represents
the fact that there are

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,815
no things that both
a and c. That is,

16
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:09,800
everything that is in a cannot
be in C. Every EI is not.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,640
See. What I asked you
to do last time was

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,665
to convert those
into Euler diagrams.

19
00:01:18,665 --> 00:01:20,510
Here are the Venn diagrams again,

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,870
every ISP and no a is c. Here.

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,660
We translate this by saying
that a is contained in B.

22
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,930
But apart from that, the
relationship between C and

23
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,740
the others is not specified here.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,050
We've missed out here to

25
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:45,109
regions of the Venn diagram
which are not inhabited.

26
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:47,510
There are eight
regions altogether.

27
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:51,560
So we should find six
regions represented here,

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,915
and we'll just do this
as a sanity check.

29
00:01:53,915 --> 00:02:02,360
There's 123456 regions
down here. Every ISP.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,775
And this represented
here, though,

31
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:08,525
actually the Euler diagram

32
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:11,990
doesn't really represent
all the possibilities.

33
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:15,530
Because the Euler diagram
means that there is

34
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,355
something in here and there
is something in here,

35
00:02:19,355 --> 00:02:22,100
and there is something
in here, and so on.

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,410
So it says that in our universe

37
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,515
there are at least six
things that are different.

38
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,950
Whereas the Venn
Diagram we interpret

39
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,965
as saying there may be
something in here or not.

40
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:36,620
We don't know. There may be
something in here or not.

41
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,090
We don't know, and so on.

42
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,575
We do know that there's nothing
in either of these areas.

43
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:45,095
So the Venn diagram,

44
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:47,435
let's us say less,

45
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,070
which is important because then

46
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,660
there are more things we can say.

47
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,690
We can say this much
without committing

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,790
ourselves to the
fact that therefore

49
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,920
there must be something
in each of these.

50
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,495
Whereas with the Euler diagram,

51
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:01,400
you make that commitment.

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,700
If we do the same thing with
the other diagram here,

53
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,965
then we're missing out these two.

54
00:03:06,965 --> 00:03:09,860
Again, we should
find six regions,

55
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,110
and if we count them, it's
easy to make a mistake.

56
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,775
Humans I, one.

57
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:18,215
2345, there are five regions,

58
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:25,265
but if you counted
carefully, you get 123456.

59
00:03:25,265 --> 00:03:27,560
If you are doing
an Euler diagram,

60
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,740
you represent all
the possibilities.

61
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,480
But as I say, if we interpret

62
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,414
this strictly is
an Euler diagram,

63
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,650
then it saying that
there are six things,

64
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,375
one in each of these regions.

65
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,750
And that's not what we want
to say with a Venn diagram.

66
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,850
Now I want you to try

67
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:46,325
an exercise in the
opposite direction.

68
00:03:46,325 --> 00:03:49,880
Given an Euler diagram,

69
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,540
can you derive a Venn diagram?

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,320
So what is the venn
diagram like for this?

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,680
And what is the venn
diagram like for this?

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,170
And all the Euler
diagrams are going

73
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,375
to show that there are

74
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:11,030
1234 things that are inhabited,

75
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,040
If you consider is annoy diagram,

76
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,235
I want you to mount the
ones that are empty.

77
00:04:16,235 --> 00:04:18,380
The Venn diagram that we then get

78
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,480
will tell us at least
the ones that are

79
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,420
empty and leave us flexibility
about whether there's

80
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,930
anything in the four
regions represented here.

81
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:31,610
Again, here we have 1234 regions.

82
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,170
So there are four regions which

83
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:35,420
should be possibly inhabited.

84
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,370
In your Venn diagram.

85
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,355
Pause the video while
you try doing that.

86
00:04:40,355 --> 00:04:43,190
You should get
something like this.

87
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,470
In each of these examples,

88
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,070
we have four regions
that will be inhabited.

89
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,304
So we should have four regions

90
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:52,955
which will not be inhabited.

91
00:04:52,955 --> 00:04:55,760
And then we can check that
we have the right ones.

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,460
This is things in here are in
a and in B and C. So there,

93
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,555
there things in here are
in B and C, but not in a.

94
00:05:08,555 --> 00:05:14,435
So they are in B and
C, but not in a.

95
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:17,615
Things here are a and C,

96
00:05:17,615 --> 00:05:19,880
but not in a and B.

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,260
So that's this region.

98
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,365
And finally, things out
here are in none of them.

99
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,670
That's this region here.

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,825
You can do the same
exercise here.

101
00:05:29,825 --> 00:05:31,730
Here are things
that are in a new,

102
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,565
neither being nor
C. So that's here.

103
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,925
Here are things that are
not in any of them here.

104
00:05:37,925 --> 00:05:41,150
Things that are in C,

105
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,945
but not in B or a and C,

106
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,595
but not in B or a.

107
00:05:46,595 --> 00:05:50,495
And things that are in B and C,

108
00:05:50,495 --> 00:05:53,075
but not in a. And that's here.

109
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:57,725
These Venn diagrams correspond
to these Euler diagrams.

110
00:05:57,725 --> 00:06:02,470
And although for simple
cases like this,

111
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,665
which corresponded to
the Barbera syllogism,

112
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,110
It's easy to see what's going

113
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,615
on when you draw
an Euler diagram.

114
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:12,400
The Venn diagrams are more

115
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,080
flexible because
they don't commit

116
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,320
us to having these
regions inhabited.

117
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,574
They let us say this
one's not inhabited,

118
00:06:20,574 --> 00:06:23,620
but this May 1 or
may not be later,

119
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,410
we will introduce a notation
to say maybe that some of

120
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,400
these regions of the Venn
diagram are inhabited.

121
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,080
And then we'll be able
to say things that we

122
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,000
can't say with an oil diagram.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,579
We want to say some
things are inhabited,

124
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:40,239
some things are empty,
and other things.

125
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:43,300
We leave the question open.

126
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:47,065
We're going to talk quite
a lot about Venn diagrams.

127
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:49,749
As we'll see later, that
can get very complicated.

128
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:53,425
So we're only going to talk
about simple Venn diagrams.

129
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:58,180
This is the simplest one
with two predicates.

130
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,785
Let's say a is appetizing
and B is beautiful.

131
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:05,185
Or you could say a is
amber and B is blue.

132
00:07:05,185 --> 00:07:08,530
We can label the areas
by saying this is

133
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,355
the place where a is
true and B is false,

134
00:07:12,355 --> 00:07:14,080
a and not B.

135
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,305
This is something that's
appetizing but not beautiful.

136
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:21,234
This is something that's
appetizing and beautiful.

137
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:22,840
This is something that's not

138
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,830
appetizing and it is beautiful.

139
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,220
This is something that is not

140
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,590
appetizing and it's
not beautiful.

141
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,289
So we use these
symbols, negation,

142
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:37,310
fanout and friend and of

143
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:40,580
rho will also use

144
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:43,130
another notation for describing

145
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,990
the regions of a Venn diagram.

146
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,845
We'll often use this for
three predicate Venn diagram.

147
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:51,905
If we think of the
predicates as a, B,

148
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,650
and C, Then to tweet region,

149
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:56,690
we associate a binary number.

150
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,270
If it's a region where
all three are false,

151
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,385
then we associate the
number 000 in this region.

152
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:07,895
And the decimal value of
that, of course, is 0.

153
00:08:07,895 --> 00:08:11,915
If we're in a region
where only a is true,

154
00:08:11,915 --> 00:08:15,725
so true, false, false, 1-0-0.

155
00:08:15,725 --> 00:08:18,200
That's 100 in binary,

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,715
which is decimal for.

157
00:08:19,715 --> 00:08:22,730
So I filled in each region
here and you can check those.

158
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,680
Each region corresponds to one of

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,635
the eight binary codes
from 0 to seven.

160
00:08:27,635 --> 00:08:36,995
And we will often label
these regions, 0123, 4567.

161
00:08:36,995 --> 00:08:38,885
That's just a useful notation

162
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:40,490
if we want to refer to things

163
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,155
when we are writing

164
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:44,840
and we don't have the
opportunity to point.

165
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,180
Venn diagrams get very
complicated very quickly here

166
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,055
our Venn diagrams for

167
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:56,720
five predicates and
seven predicates.

168
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,300
These ones are very
pretty strange fact,

169
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,080
a Venn diagram that you
can rotate and it falls on

170
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,595
itself so it hasn't rotational
symmetry is possible.

171
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:11,600
The n predicates if and
only if n is prime.

172
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,400
So there's something quite
deep going on there,

173
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,370
but we're not going
to explore that.

174
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,440
What we're going to do is

175
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,925
to stick with the
somewhat you should

176
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:23,195
get from this particular video.

177
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:27,020
Is this coding used to refer

178
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,430
to the regions of the three
predicate Venn diagram.

179
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,730
And these two examples,

180
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,835
every ASB and variations on them,

181
00:09:37,835 --> 00:09:39,290
you should be able to work out

182
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,000
how to color in a Venn diagram.

183
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,570
So every CSP or every B, a,

184
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,425
C. And now ASE.

185
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:50,840
Similarly, you should
be able to say,

186
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,910
now C is a,

187
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,430
nd actually has the same diagram.

188
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,919
You should be able to say no PUC

189
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,265
and now ASB and things like that.

190
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:06,665
We use these notations
that says every a is b.

191
00:10:06,665 --> 00:10:09,935
And now we come to a subtle,

192
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:12,470
nah, not really subtle, a simple.

193
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:15,740
Now we come to a simple
but important point.

194
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,430
We've introduced the notation a

195
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:23,850
satisfies B to say
that every a is b.

196
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,600
And now here we introduce

197
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,610
some different statement which is

198
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,950
no a is c. That

199
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,020
says that every a is not c. So

200
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,810
this notation shows us

201
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,320
a similarity or relationship
between these two.

202
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,555
That's not so obvious here.

203
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:50,150
All we've done is to talk

204
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,970
about not saying in
a place of pain.

205
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,080
And that's very powerful to have

206
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,660
the algebraic
notation that lets us

207
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,954
say this is actually a statement

208
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,940
that is very similar to
this statement here.

209
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:07,985
It just is talking about
a different predicate

210
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:12,360
instead of talking about
it, talking about Nazi.

211
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,040
That's all for this video,

212
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,990
you should make
sure that you can.

213
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,820
If you want to try
an exercise to test

214
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,510
your understanding
of the shadings,

215
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,790
maybe you could try shading in

216
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,275
a few examples on the five
predicate Venn diagram,

217
00:11:42,275 --> 00:11:43,580
but we won't be doing that.

218
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,800
We'll be sticking entirely to

219
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,220
Venn diagrams with 23 predicates.

220
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,300
And what we want to go for

221
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:53,600
predicates will introduce
yet another notation,

222
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,010
which is simpler than

223
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,840
the Venn diagrams and

224
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,030
has advantages over
them in the same way,

225
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,560
the Venn diagrams have

226
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,200
an advantage of the
Euler diagrams.
