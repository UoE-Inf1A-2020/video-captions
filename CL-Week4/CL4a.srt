1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,280
Somebody end of the session

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:06,960
yesterday came out
and said, okay,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,870
so that's what you do if
you've got a Venn diagram with

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,280
three things and we

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,250
understand the syllogisms
there and what's going on.

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,370
But what would you
do if you have more?

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,520
And the answer is not quite

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,740
that you do something
completely different.

9
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,050
That's an important idea
that we're going to keep.

10
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:32,180
Which is the idea that this
relationship between a and b,

11
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:36,125
that every a is b
is very important.

12
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,910
But we'll talk about it in ways

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,550
that Aristotle didn't manage.

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,025
So let's just see what
we've done so far.

15
00:00:43,025 --> 00:00:46,040
Yesterday we got to
these syllogisms.

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,180
Here's a nice way
of organizing them.

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,505
These ones down the left.

18
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,500
This one comes because we

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,600
just look at it and see that it's

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,980
true and we check it on

21
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,440
the Venn diagram or
even the Euler diagram.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,300
This is the substitution.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,395
These are the various
contra, positions down here.

24
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:10,040
So we get this column
very easily just by

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,285
making those contract positions.

26
00:01:14,285 --> 00:01:17,810
In this layout, what I've
done to go from here to

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:19,970
here is exactly the

28
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,950
same as I did to go
from here to here.

29
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,085
Remember we went from here to
here by swapping these two,

30
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,275
negating them compared with that.

31
00:01:27,275 --> 00:01:29,270
And by swapping these two

32
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,000
negating them
compared with there.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,280
I've done the same on each line.

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,950
So this time it's more
organized because if

35
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,650
you go down on the left,
we know what we're doing.

36
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,600
We're doing those local
control positions.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,095
And if you come across
column by column,

38
00:01:45,095 --> 00:01:47,450
we're doing exactly the
same in each column,

39
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,965
so it's easier to remember.

40
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:53,690
And in fact, what you'll
see now is that the names,

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,030
these are the traditional
medieval names.

42
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,555
They line up all the ones
beginning with C. Are there,

43
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:03,830
all the ones beginning with F,

44
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,960
eta, all the ones
beginning with you there.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,780
That's because their names helped

46
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:11,885
them to remember where
these things came from.

47
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:14,630
They also use the
code for each of

48
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:20,405
the four different forms of
categorical proposition.

49
00:02:20,405 --> 00:02:22,385
This is the four forms we've got.

50
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:26,690
They labeled them
a, E, I, O minds.

51
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,070
We'll label them with something.

52
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,890
They labeled them with
the letters a, E, I, O.

53
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,515
And what Barbara tells us,

54
00:02:33,515 --> 00:02:35,210
because there's three a's.

55
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,895
It means that we've got
three of these in it.

56
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:40,085
123 A's.

57
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:44,675
Morocco tells me I have one.

58
00:02:44,675 --> 00:02:48,815
A, that's that 12 of
these, what are they?

59
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:52,070
They are this 00
fascinating piece

60
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,650
of history as to
how people organize

61
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:57,080
this kind of stuff
when they didn't have

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,920
the kind of algebraic
notation that we're using.

63
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,230
Here are the same syllogisms.

64
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,020
Is time, the variables to change,

65
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,270
to label them with
a standard names.

66
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:10,370
We have S for the subject and

67
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:13,130
p for the predicate
of the conclusion,

68
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,590
and N for the middle
variable that

69
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,080
is eliminated from
the assumptions.

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,665
So I relabeled the variables
from the previous diagram,

71
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:23,930
and that is basically the
way they will present them.

72
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:27,440
They're not in the notation
that they would use.

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,620
That was where Aristotle got to.

74
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,770
Basically, it was
where things stayed

75
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,810
until the late 18 hundreds para,

76
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,060
a 150 years ago.

77
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,465
Aristotle certainly
knew about these rules.

78
00:03:41,465 --> 00:03:43,699
He knew about these
forms of deduction.

79
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:46,550
But he didn't think they were
important to write about

80
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:49,760
because he was only focused
on the difficult ones.

81
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,940
These everybody knows
if every a is NOT B,

82
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,080
then every p is not a.

83
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,640
He would use it, but he didn't

84
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,440
think he was an important
part of the system.

85
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,440
It was just a fact you
used to prove things

86
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,920
about the system
or even more so he

87
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,040
never bothered saying
this because why would we

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,685
say it on no premises?

89
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:15,515
I can always deduce that
every ASA as the phrase goes,

90
00:04:15,515 --> 00:04:17,915
it goes without saying.

91
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:21,635
But one of the things you'll
learn in this course,

92
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:25,475
which is not specific to logic,

93
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,250
is that it's often worth writing

94
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,310
down the things that
go without saying.

95
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,695
So it's worth considering

96
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:37,040
what do I mean when
I say every ISP,

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,140
when there are now a,

98
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,315
what do I mean when
I say sum a is B?

99
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:48,275
What do I mean when I say
one of these things is true,

100
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:50,120
or every one of these
things is true.

101
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,235
What happens if
there's nothing there?

102
00:04:52,235 --> 00:04:55,775
So we need to think about
those things because it makes

103
00:04:55,775 --> 00:05:00,500
the rules more general
and easier to use.

104
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,110
We were able to get
these very easy rules

105
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,760
when you do the tutorial.

106
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,390
Next week, you will see
that Aristotle also had

107
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:12,320
this existence assumption
that lead to further rules.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,865
We can still get those,

109
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:16,475
but they make the system
more complicated.

110
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:21,020
There's a simplicity in doing
it where you do it cleanly.

111
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,760
So that's what we're
always trying to do.
