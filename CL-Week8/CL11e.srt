1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Just to go back to
these Karnaugh maps,

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,005
this is the one for o.

3
00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:05,640
And just as we did last time,

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,980
we can look at the orange
where it's true that

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,800
this is where the
ore is true here.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,890
And then they are at
the top and the bottom.

7
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,260
And then we can say,
for the bottom half,

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,980
we just copy this and for the
top half we just negated.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,810
So it's very easy
to draw these for

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,260
these particular
formulae we want to

11
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,765
use to describe logic gates.

12
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,520
So sorry, this
should be two to the

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,980
six and this is 11
times three is 33.

14
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,485
Then we will look at cnf problems

15
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:36,425
where each clause has
at most two literals.

16
00:00:36,425 --> 00:00:40,490
And for those, you will be
able to buy Han solve them.

17
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,440
So it's something we
can let you practise in

18
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,930
the exam so we'll learn about
that tomorrow. Thank you.
