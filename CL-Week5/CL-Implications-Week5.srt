00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,220
In this video, we're
going to introduce

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,925
implication by giving a
rule for implication.

3
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:17,820
Many of you wanted to
interpret this as a implies b.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,260
That's exactly right.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,740
If that is valid in a universe,

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,040
it means the same thing as saying

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,545
that in that universe,
a implies B.

8
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:34,669
We're going to analyze
what that means.

9
00:00:34,669 --> 00:00:38,435
If we take a satisfies b,

10
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:40,610
then one thing we can
do with the rules we

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,700
have is to take the
a to the other side and

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,135
negate it. So we
get not a, b.

13
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:48,500
And once we've done that,

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,115
we can apply the rule
for OR on the right,

15
00:00:52,115 --> 00:00:54,710
and we find not a or b.

16
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,320
If we put this
together with that,

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,735
we can play our
usual trick: because

18
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:02,239
these rules are valid
in any universe,

19
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,975
we can add gammas
and deltas. Here,

20
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:08,030
here, and the delta here.

21
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,200
Once we have that,

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,925
we know that we have a chain.

23
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:13,790
This is equivalent to this,

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,545
which is equivalent to this.

25
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:17,495
I'll put it at the bottom
just so we can see it.

26
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:21,980
Gamma satisfies a implies b or delta.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:27,020
If we let delta be empty and
we let gamma be not a or b,

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,830
then this says not a or b
satisfies not a or b,

29
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,615
but that's the same as not a
or b satisfies a implies b.

30
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:37,295
And that works the
other way round.

31
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,815
If I put a implies b for gamma,

32
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,880
then here I get a implies
b satisfies not a or b.

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,250
So these two will be equivalent.

34
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,010
We can write the truth
table for implies.

35
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,055
So here we have false and true,

36
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:54,905
and here we have false and true.

37
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:58,550
Let say this is a and that's b

38
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,365
for a implies b.

39
00:02:00,365 --> 00:02:03,995
When is it false
that a implies b?

40
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,860
It's false that a
implies b if we can

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,965
make 'a' true and 'b' false.

42
00:02:09,965 --> 00:02:14,855
So if a is true and
b is false. False there,

43
00:02:14,855 --> 00:02:17,930
but it must be true
everywhere else,

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,115
precisely because this is
valid wherever that is valid.

45
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:25,835
So that's a rule for a implies b.

46
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:28,100
Now we can do another trick:

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,020
let's find a rule for

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,705
a implies b on the left. If we have

49
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:35,855
a implies b satisfies something.

50
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,090
We're going to replace that
with what we found

51
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,685
was equivalent to a implies b:

52
00:02:40,685 --> 00:02:42,305
not a OR b.

53
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:44,945
Now we're just playing our
normal game of reducing.

54
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,610
So we can use the rule for that,

55
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,175
which is if gamma together with

56
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:52,265
not a satisfies delta

57
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:56,210
and gamma together with
b satisfies delta.

58
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:58,580
So now we've said the rule for

59
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,460
a implies b on the left is this.

60
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,200
We can simplify slightly more.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,975
That is the same as gamma
satisfies a comma delta.

62
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:11,450
So the rule that we end up with

63
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,735
for implication on the
left is that we have

64
00:03:14,735 --> 00:03:18,200
gamma satisfies a comma delta

65
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,940
and gamma comma b
satisfies delta.

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,895
That's equivalent to gamma a
implies b satisfies delta.

67
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:32,820
So that's the rule for
implies on the left.
