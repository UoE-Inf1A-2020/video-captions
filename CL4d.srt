00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
In the previous video,

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:05,080
we introduced the room for n and

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,455
justified it by looking
at this Venn diagram.

4
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:13,975
C is contained in the
intersection of a and b.

5
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:18,100
If and only if C is
contained in a and C is

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,155
contained in B. I asked
you to do the same again.

7
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:26,005
Start with the same Venn
Diagram that we started with,

8
00:00:26,005 --> 00:00:29,395
but now made the Euler diagram
where you say something

9
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:36,740
about the relationship between
your new thing and a or B.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,330
And I have 0B is of
course the union.

11
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,460
And try and write down a rule.

12
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,280
If we're going to draw
a general thing that's

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,759
related to a or B.

14
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,625
And what we want to do
is to draw outside.

15
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,299
If you went back and
imagine this on the sphere,

16
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,085
it wouldn't look so different.

17
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:03,310
If you imagine the original
one for end on the sphere,

18
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,980
and imagine this
one on the sphere,

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,719
then they'd be the same,

20
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:10,870
except that you
will be considering

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,349
the positive direction for
a and b to be reversed.

22
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:15,910
That's all the differences.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,405
I'm not going to try and
draw it on the board.

24
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,715
It's easier to do with
the physical pole,

25
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:24,130
but it's worth thinking
about it because

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,750
that fact, really
DeMorgan's laws.

27
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,310
Try and think of this stretched

28
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,200
out, wrapped round sphere.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,640
And try and think of the previous

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,620
diagram done the same way.

31
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,210
And you will find that they are

32
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:39,320
the same diagram that just
looked at upside down.

33
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,380
Again, it's this thing of
if we change the direction,

34
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,940
if we go to negatives,

35
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,410
then we get these
nice symmetry is

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,615
going that we've seen
with contraposition.

37
00:01:47,615 --> 00:01:50,075
This blue thing is C,

38
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:53,360
and C is greater than this.

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,900
In other words,
everything in here is x3,

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,835
it everything in AC,

41
00:01:58,835 --> 00:02:02,390
and everything in
B is C. So again,

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,705
we get a row, goes two ways.

43
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:08,869
And it really is the same rule,

44
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,425
same backwards if you
draw it on the sphere.

45
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:15,020
This is just like a slide for n,

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,290
except we've changed
the truth table up

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,870
the top to be the truth table

48
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:23,585
for all its only
when both are false,

49
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:26,330
then we return a
false part from that.

50
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,510
This is just the name
for all the semantic or,

51
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:33,425
the, or on predicates it sort of.

52
00:02:33,425 --> 00:02:36,320
Returning to the previous slide.

53
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:40,910
Notice that a or B
satisfy C if and

54
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,890
only if a satisfies C
and B satisfies S0.

55
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,205
Sometimes people think
this should be an O.

56
00:02:49,205 --> 00:02:50,870
That's an and here,

57
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,110
just as there was in
the room for end.

58
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,320
But the a's and b's
are on the left here,

59
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,560
whereas in the roof and
they're on the right.

60
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Look, look at this diagram.

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,495
It's not one of them is
contained in the blue one.

62
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:08,015
They both have to be
contained in the blue one

63
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,360
is the blue one is going
to encompass a or b,

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,085
which is what we are saying.

65
00:03:13,085 --> 00:03:15,995
This is I obey and it says,

66
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,160
the blue one includes
everything and I obey.

67
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,450
You have to get your
head around it.

68
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,625
But once you get your
head around it, it works.

69
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:26,000
I hope if I draw

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,995
a blue one and I've got
to draw it around AOB.

71
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:33,425
Aob is just the union
of those two circles.

72
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:37,325
So the only way to
draw it around AOB is

73
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:39,185
it certainly has to go around a

74
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,390
and it has to go
around B and said,

75
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,070
oh, I could draw

76
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,145
something around a that
doesn't go ramping.

77
00:03:46,145 --> 00:03:49,850
Now we have simple rules for not.

78
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,950
And, and all.

79
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,690
These are valid in

80
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,680
any universe for any
predicates a, B, and C.
