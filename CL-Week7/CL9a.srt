1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,555
Good morning. Today and tomorrow,

2
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:05,685
we're going to look
at an algorithm

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:07,905
that was developed just
before the Beatles.

4
00:00:07,905 --> 00:00:10,260
In those days, computers were

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,045
roughly 30 thousand times
slower than they are today.

6
00:00:15,045 --> 00:00:17,235
So when that algorithm
was developed,

7
00:00:17,235 --> 00:00:20,730
it would take about 30
hours to do what we

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,305
can do in a couple of seconds

9
00:00:22,305 --> 00:00:24,195
with the same algorithm today,

10
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:25,545
we'll see later on,

11
00:00:25,545 --> 00:00:27,000
this algorithm will solve

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,390
a Sudoku problem in
just over two seconds.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,260
There's a list of roughly 50
thousand Sudoku problems,

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:36,915
which it'll work through
in about 30 hours.

15
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,445
No supercomputers, just a

16
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:40,950
six year-old laptop
conduit in about 30 hours,

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,865
all 50 thousand back
in the sixties,

18
00:00:43,865 --> 00:00:45,920
it would have taken
those 30 hours

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,050
to do one of those problems.

20
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,765
So when they develop this,
it was quite something.

21
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:53,630
Suddenly you had a
computer that could do

22
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,395
Sudoku problem almost as
fast as a very stupid human.

23
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,990
Nowadays, we have a
computer that can do so

24
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,410
GOP Sudoku problems much
faster than any human.

25
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,960
But before we get
onto that algorithm,

26
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,615
I just want to go back
and do a little recap

27
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,180
of where we're at now
because we're changing gear,

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,660
we're going from looking at
Logic is something out there

29
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,310
to locate logic as something

30
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,395
we really implement on computer.

31
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:20,090
Just to summarize
what we've done so

32
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,130
far, we introduce predicates.

33
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:25,235
Along with syllogisms, we
have a universe of things.

34
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,290
A predicate is something which

35
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,390
is true of some things
and false of others.

36
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:30,875
In other words, it's a function.

37
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,180
From things to Boolean.

38
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,460
We define what it means for every

39
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,295
a to satisfy B or every a is b.

40
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,200
And we had this whole
theory of Syllogisms,

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,110
which was really to do with
either negating the bee

42
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:45,724
that only gating the
satisfies relation.

43
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:49,280
And we got all of Aristotle's
theory of syllogisms.

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,100
But then we introduced
operations on predicate,

45
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,740
which if you think of the
predicate as a set of things,

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,815
the operations like
intersection and union.

47
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:01,985
But we express them as
operations on functions.

48
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,205
And now we have the
lambda notation.

49
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,200
We can express those
functions like this,

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,465
which may make it a
little less mysterious.

51
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:10,010
Why we have something with

52
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,725
two arguments that
returns one thing here,

53
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:14,540
because we put the x over that.

54
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,950
That's just a notation you didn't

55
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:18,230
have when we first
introduce those,

56
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:21,020
this was the theory
of syllogisms.

57
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,485
We found ways of saying
that this one is valid,

58
00:02:24,485 --> 00:02:25,970
then that one's valid or this

59
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,725
one's valley going
from one to another.

60
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,140
That is the things you
should be able to do.

61
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,700
We found ways of showing,

62
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,530
if I present you with
something that's

63
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,915
invalidate the purports
to be a syllogism.

64
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,180
You can actually use
Venn diagrams to

65
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,060
create a counterexample and
show that it's invalid.

66
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,940
Then we extended that
definition by saying

67
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,410
instead of having one thing on

68
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,045
either side of the turnstile,

69
00:02:47,045 --> 00:02:48,980
we can have a finite
set of thing,

70
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,780
But we defined what
this means for

71
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,850
finite sets in terms of

72
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,460
its meaning for a simple
predicate on either side,

73
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,385
we said if we take the
intersection of all of these,

74
00:02:58,385 --> 00:03:00,875
satisfies the union
of all of those.

75
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,545
In other words, if every
one of these is true,

76
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:05,675
then at least one
of these is true,

77
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:06,980
then that was the relation

78
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,855
between finite
sets, a predicates.

79
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,720
And we also can define
these functions.

80
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,225
The end over a number
of predicates and the,

81
00:03:14,225 --> 00:03:16,610
or our number of
predicate in Haskell.

82
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,515
Again, using lambda notation,

83
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:21,350
it might make it clearer once
you've got your head around

84
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,010
lambda notation than it was
when we put the x back here,

85
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,585
gamma satisfies delta if for
everything in the universe,

86
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,015
if every gamma we have this,

87
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:34,325
then one of the
deltas we have that.

88
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:36,950
Then for that relationship,

89
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,405
we have these rules.

90
00:03:38,405 --> 00:03:39,980
And that's still a
bit of confusion

91
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,900
about these rules which
I'll try and get round.

92
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,840
So this gamma here is a set of

93
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,670
things that things I don't

94
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,935
particularly care what
they are at the moment.

95
00:03:48,935 --> 00:03:51,065
Similarly, delta, I don't
care what they are.

96
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,970
I've chosen one thing on

97
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:55,070
the left which happens
to be a disjunction.

98
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,950
And then this rule
will apply to say that

99
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,435
this satisfaction relation
is equivalent to this one.

100
00:04:02,435 --> 00:04:04,835
And this one, if I just say gamma

101
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:07,565
entails delta than
gammas are set here,

102
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:09,800
the things on the
left has to be a set

103
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,215
that we call gamma together
with one more member.

104
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:13,805
It's still a set on the left.

105
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:15,170
So you have to think gamma ray

106
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,420
sometimes standing for
everything on the left,

107
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,115
sometimes everything
on the right.

108
00:04:19,115 --> 00:04:20,780
But if I write this,
it standing for

109
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,045
everything except the
things I talked about.

110
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:24,230
And there's been some confusion,

111
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,060
but the delta is everything,

112
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,040
but it's not always
everything here.

113
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,885
It's everything except the IOP

114
00:04:29,885 --> 00:04:31,310
here it's everything
except the not

115
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,840
a on the right here it's

116
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,565
everything because I don't
mention anything else.

117
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,005
If you have problems with that,

118
00:04:36,005 --> 00:04:37,550
bring it up your tutorial

119
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,230
and make sure you've
got that sorted out.

120
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,165
When we apply those rules,

121
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:43,175
we choose a main connective.

122
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:44,480
Here there's only one choice

123
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,800
because there's only one thing.

124
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,345
Its main connective is here.

125
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,340
When I apply a rule to this,

126
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,600
then there's nothing on the left.

127
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,610
So this matches the rule,

128
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,515
but with gamma being
the empty set,

129
00:04:54,515 --> 00:04:56,375
with delta being the empty set.

130
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,070
And this just being
this, all this.

131
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,710
And it in fact matches
the rule or on the right,

132
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,735
when I go up here,

133
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,880
in this case, I match with

134
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,845
this gamma is then this
piece, just a singleton.

135
00:05:09,845 --> 00:05:12,410
Delta is these two things.

136
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,335
And we apply the rule
when I do this one.

137
00:05:15,335 --> 00:05:18,725
Gamma is to be the gamma
because these are sets.

138
00:05:18,725 --> 00:05:20,510
The gamma doesn't have to be on

139
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,150
one particular side of
the thing you've chosen.

140
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,955
This is something I've chosen
and the rest is gamma.

141
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:28,835
This is something I've chosen
here. The B is the gamma.

142
00:05:28,835 --> 00:05:30,395
So when you're doing
those matchings,

143
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,915
the order in which the
B and the gamma come.

144
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,370
The B might be in the middle.

145
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,050
Nine gamma rays to
all the other things.

146
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,150
When you do the matching,
I think you're all

147
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,550
able to make these
inference trees now,

148
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,730
certainly all the tutorials
I was looking and I

149
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:47,345
looked in quite a few people
were managing to make those.

150
00:05:47,345 --> 00:05:49,160
That's the important
thing provided you

151
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,395
can actually
operationally to this,

152
00:05:51,395 --> 00:05:53,495
you are at least 80%
of the way there.

153
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:56,450
And if you're 80% of the
way there on everything,

154
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,400
you might get 80% in the exam.

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,845
And if you get more
than 80% in the exam,

156
00:06:00,845 --> 00:06:02,660
then you are doing
extremely well anyway.

157
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,850
So don't worry if you're
only getting 80%.

158
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,400
Here. We had two examples.

159
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,140
We reduced a sequent to
something simpler. In the US.

160
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,330
One, we reduced it to saying,

161
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,750
nothing needs to be true in
order to make this true.

162
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,700
In other words, this
is universally valid.

163
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,370
Here, we reduce this
to saying this is

164
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,610
equivalent to this
and this being valid.

165
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,520
And just that simple
operation or procedure of

166
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,000
reducing a sequence to a
set of simple sequence,

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,100
where simple just means
there's no notes,

168
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,750
no one's, there was no bats.

169
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,140
We use that reduction to
Shell things a universally

170
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,970
valid if everything goes via

171
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,565
the immediate r2 to
provide counter-examples,

172
00:06:43,565 --> 00:06:45,695
it not everything goes
by the immediate rule,

173
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,565
but also in the tutorial
you used to compute.

174
00:06:49,565 --> 00:06:51,185
Left and right rules.

175
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:54,410
The other connectives,
you use them to derive

176
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,770
lots of equations between
Boolean expressions,

177
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,105
which I'll put up
on the next slide.

178
00:06:59,105 --> 00:07:01,490
And you use them to convert

179
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,610
an expression to a
conjunctive normal form

180
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,815
suggests it's one
reduction process.

181
00:07:06,815 --> 00:07:09,230
Lets you do all those
different things and

182
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,900
the rules of Boolean
algebra that you checked.

183
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,385
I think we gave all of these,

184
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,630
but if we didn't
give all of these,

185
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:17,060
you can check the others,
the Boolean operations AND,

186
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,485
and OR are associative.

187
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,500
We had these two distributive
laws. They're commutative.

188
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,335
That means that X or Y
is the same as y or x.

189
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:27,140
You know that we've shown that
it follows from the rules.

190
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,540
We have these what
are called unit,

191
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,760
the units XOR 0 is x,

192
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,240
x and one is x when you're
using things like AND,

193
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,560
and OR with fold,

194
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,700
then these units, which
are true and false,

195
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,470
are very useful things
because when you're

196
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,270
doing fold of an operation,

197
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,595
you often want a unit
for that operation.

198
00:07:46,595 --> 00:07:48,650
Apply in the base
case, annihilation,

199
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:50,435
these ones annihilate what comes

200
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:52,730
0 and anything just
kills the neat

201
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,740
it's called annihilation
pick dramatic item

202
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,930
potent every ten x or x, it's x.

203
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,880
And if we take x and x is x,

204
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,070
and the compliments that x or

205
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,695
not x is true and x
and not x is false.

206
00:08:03,695 --> 00:08:06,110
This one you probably
haven't seen

207
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,675
and it's sometimes useful and
it's worth looking at this.

208
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:11,270
If you take x or x and y,

209
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:14,525
where x and y gets
smaller than x,

210
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:18,230
if you take x again and OR it
with it, you get back to x.

211
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,420
So x or x and y as x.

212
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:24,110
And similarly x and x or y
is x going the other way.

213
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,930
So those are all things
you might ponder over.

214
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,790
We would expect you
to know most of them.

215
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,090
Use reduction, using
Jensen rules to do

216
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,445
all these things show
the universal validity,

217
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:35,810
provide counter-examples.

218
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,760
Compute DLR rules, convert to

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,295
CNF derived Boolean equations.

220
00:08:40,295 --> 00:08:43,340
But there's one kind of
example I haven't shown you.

221
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,864
I want to give you the simplest
example of this example.

222
00:08:46,864 --> 00:08:51,050
What happens if we reduce
this using the rules?

223
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:52,490
What rule applies?

224
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,250
There is only one
connective at the top here.

225
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,755
The end rule applies.

226
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,560
If I have a and B on the
right of the turnstile,

227
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,030
we split with I turnstile

228
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,090
a end-to-end style be
to show that a and B,

229
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,160
you show a and you Shelby,

230
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,110
that we need to show that.

231
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,705
And that. Now what
that tells me is,

232
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,465
it's easy to make
a counterexample.

233
00:09:14,465 --> 00:09:16,700
To make a counterexample
either make

234
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,235
this one false or I
make this one false.

235
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:21,020
Either way, it's
a counterexample.

236
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,090
In fact, everything's
a counterexample that

237
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,640
it's impossible to
find an example.

238
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,075
We can't find something that
makes one of these true,

239
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:32,540
which means make this true
and makes one of these true.

240
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,830
So if we took

241
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,515
a much more complicated
thing on the bottom,

242
00:09:36,515 --> 00:09:39,065
we would get to a cnf up the top.

243
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:40,700
And using that CNF,

244
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,100
we could have a counterexample to

245
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,710
the universal validity
of what we started from.

246
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,480
But we don't know that what

247
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,415
we started from his satisfiable.

248
00:09:49,415 --> 00:09:51,935
This is the simplest example
to show that we don't,

249
00:09:51,935 --> 00:09:53,525
we don't know it's satisfiable.

250
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:56,045
We may have these huge
cnf and we think,

251
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:57,260
yeah, if I make that one false,

252
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,640
I've got a counterexample
that's easy.

253
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,110
It's easy to make them false.

254
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,565
But how do we find

255
00:10:01,565 --> 00:10:03,470
evaluation that makes all

256
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,940
of these things up the top true?

257
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,500
In other words, how
do we find evaluation

258
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,880
makes our initial thing true?

259
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,760
It might just be like this
one, a contradiction.

260
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,115
That's what the algorithm
we're going to look at.

261
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:17,000
Does. It says, When
you've reduced something

262
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,245
to cnf or maybe produced it
in the first place as a cnf.

263
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:26,850
Then how do you look for
a satisfying valuation?
