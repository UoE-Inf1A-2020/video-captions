1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,970
And now we're going to
look at how we can use

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:11,145
the Venn Diagrams to
show some syllogisms,

3
00:00:11,145 --> 00:00:14,985
but include these
things his a syllogism.

4
00:00:14,985 --> 00:00:17,655
We're going to try and prove.

5
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:21,990
We're going to try
and prove this one.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,569
Here. This is every baby

7
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:33,945
is not C. So that means
here's b and c up here.

8
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:37,785
And to say, every day is not c,

9
00:00:37,785 --> 00:00:41,060
is to say there are now obese RC.

10
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,205
So no B and C means
that bit is empty.

11
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:50,010
Every city is not a is false.

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,695
That means that some say is a.

13
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:58,890
So that means this
one is inhabited.

14
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:03,500
If I put those together,

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,075
then I put the green in here,

16
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:13,535
those two, but now I
put the gray in here.

17
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,520
Now why have I drawn
it that way rather

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,655
than leaving that
middle bit green?

19
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:22,670
Why have I chosen Detroit
where trust in Detroit.

20
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,010
We know two facts.

21
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,640
We know that this pits empty.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,320
And we know that this
bit's got something in it.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,025
If we know that
something's empty,

24
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,140
and we divided into two parts,

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,470
we know both parts are empty.

26
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,110
But now we're going to
think about what happens if

27
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,970
we know that this pit

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,010
empty and that bit's

29
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,455
got something any,
what's it? Tell us?

30
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:53,060
The thing that's in

31
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,120
here can't be in the
top half of here,

32
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,055
so it must be in the bottom half.

33
00:01:58,055 --> 00:02:00,020
If you think about
it and you were

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,000
doing it with apples and
oranges or something,

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,145
it will be perfectly obvious.

36
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:05,960
But by the time you've taken

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,495
a new turn it into
symbols plus c,

38
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:13,355
what we now do is to
say this is inhabited.

39
00:02:13,355 --> 00:02:18,065
What I'm trying to show is
that this plate is inhabited,

40
00:02:18,065 --> 00:02:20,150
which you see this
works completely

41
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,575
differently from being empty.

42
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,254
If we say something is empty

43
00:02:23,254 --> 00:02:25,100
and every part of it is empty.

44
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,460
If we want to show that
something is inhabited,

45
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,710
it's sufficient to show
that one piece of it is

46
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,605
inhabited because that means
there is something in here.

47
00:02:33,605 --> 00:02:35,645
We don't know where it
is, but it's in here.

48
00:02:35,645 --> 00:02:40,820
So this is a valid syllogism.

49
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,730
Syllogisms don't have to
correspond with the world.

50
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,170
First of all, as a supposition,

51
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,165
no mathematician is infallible.

52
00:02:47,165 --> 00:02:49,430
Some programmers
and mathematicians,

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,700
so some programmers are fallible,

54
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,950
fallible and infallible are
negations of each other.

55
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,140
So in natural language we
don't always have the not.

56
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,090
So that's what you get for
being a mathematician.

57
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:01,820
You, you get the fallibility
of mathematicians.

58
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,200
But of course, from being

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,029
a mathematician and a programmer,

60
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:06,530
you also get some good things

61
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,330
like you can make little proofs

62
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,920
like this and they'll

63
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,630
actually help you write
correct programs.

64
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,060
Now here's an example
for you to look

65
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:18,550
at all plants, fungi,

66
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,815
some flowers and plants,

67
00:03:20,815 --> 00:03:24,130
therefore, some
flowers or not fungi.

68
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,915
The question for you is,

69
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:28,060
is this a valid argument?

70
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,135
But I want you to do is
give it as a syllogism.

71
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,580
Then use Venn diagrams
to either show it's

72
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,520
valid or produce
a counterexample.

73
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,440
So first of all,

74
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,010
I would like you
to use for plants,

75
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,850
fungi, and see for flowers.

76
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,070
And then try and do this and

77
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,915
see whether it is a
correct argument.

78
00:03:49,915 --> 00:03:51,670
Now you should hope the video,

79
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,000
take a break, do the
exercise, and then come back.
