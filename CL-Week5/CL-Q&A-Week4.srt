1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Normally Claudia does that,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,890
but it seems we are
without her, which is fine.

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,600
Okay, let me just recap
briefly for the recording.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,275
We're looking at
this sequent here,

5
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:15,990
and we're trying to reduce
it using the rules.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,640
And we'll see what
reduction means as we

7
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,410
go through to the
first thing I did.

8
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,845
This is not A or B satisfies
not a and not B,

9
00:00:25,845 --> 00:00:31,680
which is one of the De Morgan's rules
for pushing negations inside.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,020
In this case inside
the disjunction, I negate,

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:40,555
these two, which turns the
disjunction into a conjunction.

12
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:42,230
The first thing
we're going to do is

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,730
to address the fact we got an

14
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,809
not here by taking this
rule for negation.

15
00:00:47,809 --> 00:00:50,330
Rule for negation on the left,

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,730
which says if I have a
negation on the left,

17
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,910
I can move the a turnstile
and change the sign.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,910
So what I've done is to
move this not a or b,

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,970
across the turnstile,
change its sign.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,385
And this is just copied up.

21
00:01:04,385 --> 00:01:08,180
Now I am going to address
this and I'm going to

22
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,585
focus on this conjunction here.

23
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,255
I want the rule for
conjunction on the right.

24
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:17,855
And that is that if I'm a groups

25
00:01:17,855 --> 00:01:23,055
a delta and gamma
sorry satisfies,

26
00:01:23,055 --> 00:01:31,240
and that is B comma delta that
happened from gamma.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,020
I can deduce a or
delta from gamma.

28
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:37,540
I can deduce b or delta.

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,330
Then I can deduce a and
B are delta, though.

30
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:45,610
Either something in delta is true,

31
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:52,795
in which case we can certainly
deduce the delta.

32
00:01:52,795 --> 00:01:55,960
So what we're seeing
now is that a and

33
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,615
B here and match it against this?

34
00:01:58,615 --> 00:02:00,670
We can't hear you.

35
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,280
Can you hear me now?

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,910
Yes. Sorry, good. I've no
idea why this happened.

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,125
It suddenly decided I couldn't
share audio or video.

38
00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:14,870
And you now see the camera?

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,900
Yes, you can. I have no
idea what that was.

40
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,750
Technical glitch
which came out of

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,790
nowhere. Between these two lines

42
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,050
is what you were asking me about?

43
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,610
Yes. Yes. So what I
did was to focus on

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,890
this connective, if I
could have focused

45
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,590
on this or and done things
in a different order.

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,005
But I chose to focus on this and

47
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:39,020
then I look for a rule
that will help me

48
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,580
simplify by getting rid of

49
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:46,415
this conjunction rule and the rule that I
used was this rule up here,

50
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:50,280
which we call and on the right.

51
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:55,640
Okay and that rule says in

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,845
a slightly different
order because we have,

53
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,480
think we're focusing on with

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,210
the end this first
here and then delta,

55
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:06,410
because it's a set, I could not have the 
delta before, it's the same.

56
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,925
So delta in this case
will just be this.

57
00:03:10,925 --> 00:03:14,090
I just copy the
delta up in each case.

58
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:18,260
So I copy this A or B up
in each of those cases.

59
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:26,600
Then where I had where I

60
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,410
had a I had

61
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,460
not a and not B that matches
against the a and B.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,745
So instead of copying up
the a, coming up the B,

63
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:41,105
I'm applying the rule to
this cropping up the not a,

64
00:03:41,105 --> 00:03:44,675
I've got here and there not
be which I've got here.

65
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:47,795
Because literally I
match against this rule.

66
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:51,200
And on the right, provided
I've got the matching right,

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,960
I just write up here that
the matching for that

68
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,140
one was in the rule.

69
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:03,200
I have a matching it
to what did I have?

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,355
I had a naught a in the row.

71
00:04:07,355 --> 00:04:09,110
I had to be. Do you think I

72
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,765
was matching it to I had a not B.

73
00:04:11,765 --> 00:04:16,145
And that's because I
was matching a and B

74
00:04:16,145 --> 00:04:21,335
against a and not B.

75
00:04:21,335 --> 00:04:23,855
This one was in the rule,

76
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:26,060
and this was in the
actual example that

77
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,070
I'm doing. In the rule.

78
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,860
I have a delta and I'm
matching that against

79
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,065
the singleton which
only contains a or b.

80
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:39,960
So that's the way that this line,

81
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,520
o and gamma is empty.

82
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:50,150
Because that'll make sense.
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

83
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:56,200
I am completely against this
line. With this matching.

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,895
I'll rewrite the top line,

85
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:02,455
getting this dictionary
effectively. Okay, thank you.

86
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:04,420
No way to write it down,

87
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,740
but normally you can do

88
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,330
it in your head once
you've got the idea,

89
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:09,520
but the first time I should
have explained it like that.

90
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,040
You're right. That
help. Thank you.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,460
Thank you very much. A other
questions on this one?

92
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,350
I don't hear anybody.

93
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:34,010
Are you there?

94
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,610
I know one.

95
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,300
They will raise a hand.

96
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,420
I think I'm not online.

97
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:06,070
Weekend here. It's probably
no questions. No questions.

98
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,580
It's amazing what we're going to

99
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,140
do the remainder of this week
and next week's tutorial.

100
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,320
The tutorial assignment
is really just to go

101
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,060
through a couple examples

102
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,460
like this and work through them.

103
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,785
In the tutorial.

104
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:26,510
Audio has cut-off.

105
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,920
Come back. Can you hear me?

106
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,985
Yes, we can hear you now.

107
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,175
So my question was,

108
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,890
I can only use two
questions and I

109
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,830
get four different
values for that rate.

110
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,060
So I need to get 00011011 for

111
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:59,920
me to get used to is right into.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,795
My next question was,

113
00:07:01,795 --> 00:07:04,515
in the videos for this week.

114
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:08,960
You talked about or

115
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,770
this conjunction in that
it was every C is a and B.

116
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,990
But you made a diagram in

117
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,925
which intersection of
AB was supposed to be.

118
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:26,060
But you made the sea
circle a bit smaller.

119
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,970
Not all the elements of a and B.

120
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,055
Is there a particular
reason for that?

121
00:07:31,055 --> 00:07:33,455
That certainly was
the re the reason is

122
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,140
we want to talk about
the condition where

123
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,745
every say included a and
every city is included in B.

124
00:07:43,745 --> 00:07:48,065
We're not talking about a
being equal to a and B.

125
00:07:48,065 --> 00:07:50,240
We're saying if C is

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,825
included in a and C
is included in B,

127
00:07:53,825 --> 00:08:02,375
that's the same as saying that
C is included in a and B.

128
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:05,555
So the diagram is like this.

129
00:08:05,555 --> 00:08:11,120
We've got a and we've got B.

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,755
And now we want to say,

131
00:08:12,755 --> 00:08:15,455
when is city in here?

132
00:08:15,455 --> 00:08:16,909
We don't have an inequality.

133
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:18,260
What we're talking about here

134
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,970
is an inequality effectively,

135
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:24,080
we are saying when is c
contained in a, contained in B?

136
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,820
That the picture is we

137
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,530
want to know when C
is contained in them.

138
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,390
So not necessarily it would be

139
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,520
true for the
intersection of them.

140
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,180
It's certainly true that
the intersection satisfies

141
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,890
a and the intersection B.

142
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:46,970
That's because a and B
is contained in a and B.

143
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,670
This is a more general
thing that we say.

144
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,230
In some sense. That's
the big difference

145
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:58,730
between logic and
ordinary algebra.

146
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,350
We're interested in or in

147
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,090
these relationships
rather than inequalities.

148
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:07,940
That make some sense.

149
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,530
Yeah, I got that.

150
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,795
My other question
was in terms of the

151
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:16,930
and that we use the one
which has and colon.

152
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,785
And yes, it is from Yue Du Bu.

153
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,945
Like one function you
double than it is.

154
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:25,810
Again, you do bool and
at the end it gives

155
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,560
you Y does not give you
only bool at the end.

156
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,660
Like why is it you who ruined?

157
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,435
Because, okay, what we want to do

158
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:39,430
is in this case we
want to take a and B.

159
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:42,430
And both of those
and the functions,

160
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,830
this is a picture of a function.

161
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:55,145
So a is of type due to boom
and be a tie due to bool.

162
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:58,880
And what we want to do
is to make something.

163
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,010
We've got one predicate,
we got another predicate.

164
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,540
We want to make the predicate,

165
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,069
which is the intersection,

166
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,870
so, which is this piece?

167
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:07,445
And how do we define it?

168
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:11,555
We defined it by
saying, Dave, I take,

169
00:10:11,555 --> 00:10:14,870
I'll write it without the
Haskell premium if I take

170
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:18,740
a and B and apply to x,

171
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,155
and that's the same as taking.

172
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:23,165
We are taking a point in here,

173
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:27,170
an x, we're saying
is again a and B.

174
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:34,085
So here it's not because
it's in B, but not in a.

175
00:10:34,085 --> 00:10:37,025
Out here it is. In a
but he's not in B.

176
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:39,110
And here, how do I check?

177
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,640
Is it in a? I apply

178
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,320
this function and see
if I get through.

179
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,735
So I'll get a true b of x here,

180
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:46,190
but I won't get a true pariah

181
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,560
that here I'll get
true for both them.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,380
So this is equal to
a of x and p of x.

183
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,670
Now here I'm using

184
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,770
the same symbol as I would

185
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,125
use if these were just
two truth values.

186
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:03,785
I've used the same symbol
for the and on predicates.

187
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:07,325
And the, and on truth values go.

188
00:11:07,325 --> 00:11:09,680
You have to be a
little more precise.

189
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,030
I have to say the end on

190
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:13,760
predicates is a
different operation.

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:23,515
Truth values. Then
we say a and, okay,

192
00:11:23,515 --> 00:11:24,880
that's how we wrote it and,

193
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:33,475
and be applied to X equals a,

194
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:36,940
a applied to x.

195
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,000
And then that's the
operation on booleans.

196
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,745
So we really just define and on

197
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:49,314
predicates using the
end on Booleans.

198
00:11:49,314 --> 00:11:52,150
But in Haskell we use
different names for them.

199
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,930
But I still don't get why
the output is you do bool.

200
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:00,120
Because what we want the output
we want to put you in a,

201
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,140
we want to put in B, and
we want to get this thing.

202
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,570
What is this thing?
It's a subset.

203
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,320
But in the function,

204
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,180
you get a of x,

205
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,695
you get true or false,

206
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:14,030
and we'll be off anti-aligned.

207
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,475
I get true or false.
It's just yeah.

208
00:12:16,475 --> 00:12:21,500
And like whatever,
combat that for any x.

209
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,065
So you see this thing

210
00:12:24,065 --> 00:12:27,155
comes out true or false
once we're given an x,

211
00:12:27,155 --> 00:12:30,800
it says, I take an individual x,

212
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,885
x will be of type U.

213
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,780
And I apply a and,

214
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,820
and b to this thing of type u.

215
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,860
What is the result? So x is
one of these things here.

216
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,830
Well, here we are trying to

217
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,845
work out where it is
looking at these two.

218
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,945
And we give a true,

219
00:12:50,945 --> 00:12:54,335
they're both true,
then it will be true.

220
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:57,515
If one of them is false and
it will give us a false.

221
00:12:57,515 --> 00:12:59,330
It'll be over all function

222
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,145
as being defined
as you'd be bool.

223
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:06,215
Because we are giving
xt and edges. I view.

224
00:13:06,215 --> 00:13:11,600
This is just like a
normal if I say f of x

225
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:19,940
equals x and v of x.

226
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,719
And what will let f be a
function of x is two Booleans.

227
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:29,670
Or what's happening here.

228
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,080
Okay, so we're defining
a function here.

229
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,570
I understand why it's
difficult to get because

230
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,115
most languages don't work like

231
00:13:37,115 --> 00:13:39,065
this and we don't use
functions so much.

232
00:13:39,065 --> 00:13:41,630
But this is what
makes language like

233
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,150
Haskell really powerful
is that we can do this,

234
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:47,225
we can find functions
from other functions.

235
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:52,625
And it turns out to be quite
a powerful way of computing.

236
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,880
Ran. I got when you've got that,

237
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,040
you've got a long way in your
understanding of Haskell,

238
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,240
So I'm glad you got it.

239
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
And if other people are
still having problems,

240
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,595
by all means, ask again or or.

241
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,470
Ask your, ask your friends

242
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,940
and discuss it
amongst yourselves.

243
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,545
But this is really

244
00:14:09,545 --> 00:14:12,470
an example of something
we'll do a lot in Haskell.

245
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,450
We wanted to define
a new function.

246
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,075
We say, how do I
define a function?

247
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:20,510
What it does for a
given x o here I

248
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,025
say how to define

249
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:24,994
a new function made
out of two functions.

250
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:27,530
I'll define what he
does by saying what

251
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,720
it does to annex
what it does is to

252
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,095
apply the first function 2x plus

253
00:14:33,095 --> 00:14:34,790
the second function 2x and

254
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,605
then take the
conjunction of those.

255
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,530
And that's happening here.
Just because of the typing.

256
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:41,570
We have two different notations

257
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,565
for and we normally
don't think of that.

258
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,295
If you think of what's
going on in the real world.

259
00:14:46,295 --> 00:14:52,475
This intersection here is
intersecting two sets.

260
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:57,380
We define it in terms of
the unknown truth values.

261
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,870
Something is in bits in

262
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,005
this one as a Boolean
value, is it not?

263
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,640
And it's in this one, it's

264
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,620
a Boolean, value, it
in this one or not.

265
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,285
So it's in here.

266
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,650
It's in both of these.

267
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,770
That's all this is
saying. Thank you.

268
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:19,160
Ok. I think your next Yes.

269
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,760
Can you hear me? I can
hear you. Thank you.

270
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,580
Yeah. So I was late to
this Asia, East Asia.

271
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,065
So like what you,

272
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:32,360
what you are doing in the
beginning of this session is

273
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,455
that irradiation
of DeMorgan's law.

274
00:15:36,455 --> 00:15:38,255
I want to ask, is this,

275
00:15:38,255 --> 00:15:40,655
how we derive this
DeMorgan's law?

276
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:42,185
Or is kind of,

277
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:44,930
we have these rules,
we have this sequence.

278
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,600
We can reduce it by
applying the rules

279
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
backwards and we find that
we end up no assumptions.

280
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,390
So that tells us,
this is always valid.

281
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,690
That tells us that this

282
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,765
predicate is contained in this

283
00:15:59,765 --> 00:16:03,005
predicate always in
any universe, plenty.

284
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:07,220
Or you could say a and
B, not of a or B is

285
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,270
contained in not a and not B. Oh,

286
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,410
that those two are equal.

287
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:17,670
We have to also show the
inequality the other way round.

288
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,960
That's just the inequality.

289
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,630
If we show that one, which
we can do in the same way.

290
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,420
But I'll leave as an
exercise for you guys.

291
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,240
Then we will have shown
they're equal because it

292
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,105
says one predicate is
contained in the other.

293
00:16:32,105 --> 00:16:35,690
It says it's also contain the
other way to think of sets.

294
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:37,250
If one is contained in the other,

295
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,170
the other is contained
in the first,

296
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,050
and they're both equal.
That's what weekly.

297
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,000
That's the way we
define the equality

298
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,610
predicates that help, yeah.

299
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,475
And my question is that netbook,

300
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,215
in the textbook there's a white

301
00:16:51,215 --> 00:16:53,225
rabbit or the other sound.

302
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,130
Like because in the book I say

303
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,335
that they're doing different.

304
00:16:57,335 --> 00:17:00,200
Yeah, that was that was
a deduction. I did.

305
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,185
Where we show we show that

306
00:17:03,185 --> 00:17:04,790
what Don does in the book

307
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,010
because I did it last
year in the lectures,

308
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,170
I'll show you the kind
of proof we give.

309
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,595
If we take not a or not b.

310
00:17:13,595 --> 00:17:15,755
And here we're going to tell you,

311
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:18,230
it might have been the other
DeMorgan's law you have,

312
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,730
but this will be the same.

313
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,380
Okay? So now what I'm going to

314
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,600
do is to apply the rules to this.

315
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,060
I have an order on the right.

316
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,655
I can say that that's.

317
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:31,970
Not a, not b.

318
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,475
And because these are negated,

319
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,875
can bring both those
to the other side.

320
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:40,100
That's a, B.

321
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,820
This is valid if and
only if this is valid.

322
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,020
Because each of these
is a double root.

323
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:55,070
Does that make sense?
Yes. Okay. This is

324
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,230
the rule or on the
right and this is

325
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,510
the rule for not on the
right applied twice,

326
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,995
but I just add them together.

327
00:18:00,995 --> 00:18:03,410
And now we'll do the same
thing here or others,

328
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,590
the same procedure that we
have to start with the not.

329
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,940
So that becomes a and the, okay.

330
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:18,350
You've got this aside and
take away this negation.

331
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:22,310
Now I use the rule on
the left, the room,

332
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,620
and on the left is that
we can get about that.

333
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,080
This is equivalent to, this
is equivalent to this,

334
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,370
but that's the same as that.

335
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,035
So these are
certainly equivalent.

336
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:35,600
This is equivalent to, this
is equivalent to this.

337
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:40,865
So what this says is in a
universe where this is valid,

338
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:43,565
this is valid and vice versa.

339
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,170
And that was the kind
of proof that was

340
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,670
given in that other one.

341
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,170
Is that what you
were talking about?

342
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,625
I think he probably is.

343
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:55,625
Yes. Yes. And now lacked
the n on the left.

344
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,635
Is that saying that a and b,

345
00:18:57,635 --> 00:18:59,570
and this i is equivalent.

346
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,760
So a comma b.

347
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,830
Let me read what this says

348
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:12,650
is we can have of a and b true.

349
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,410
Because what this says
is if both of these are

350
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,755
true and something on
the right is true,

351
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:21,870
this there's nothing
on the right.

352
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,480
Yes. When these both be true.

353
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,195
The other way to use

354
00:19:29,195 --> 00:19:32,180
this is instead of just
doing this with these,

355
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,130
you know, gamma deltas,

356
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,280
I can put gamma
that an adulterer.

357
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,390
They're everywhere.

358
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:46,025
Because we know that those
rules are also valid.

359
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:49,355
And now we can play

360
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:53,705
a trick to remember
if a rule is valid,

361
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:56,630
we can always add
things either sides,

362
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,505
long as we keep the
things the same.

363
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,655
And it's just like talking
about smaller universe.

364
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:05,195
If the rule I had originally
was valid in all universes.

365
00:20:05,195 --> 00:20:07,205
And this rule with
the extra piece,

366
00:20:07,205 --> 00:20:09,200
It's valid in all universities.

367
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,500
And now the trick is to say, oh,

368
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,470
well let's let gamma
be not a or not,

369
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,330
just that single thing.

370
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:22,370
If I start here.

371
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:24,320
That's certainly true
because now I have

372
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,600
the same thing on both sides.

373
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,380
If gamma equals not a or not b,

374
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,050
Amazon certainly satisfies not

375
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,810
a or not b because it's
the same on each side.

376
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,420
For that gamma. This is true.

377
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,560
It's true that not a or not
B entails not a or not b.

378
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,615
And keep that same gamma here.

379
00:20:44,615 --> 00:20:46,490
That same gamma here.

380
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,250
Gamma. We find that.

381
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,580
Not a or B,

382
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,265
actually in a and B.

383
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:01,475
Or we can go that way by
letting gamma B that.

384
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,565
And now what we're
going to do is to go

385
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:08,165
the other way or doing the
same trick effectively.

386
00:21:08,165 --> 00:21:13,835
So that was 11 derivation.
Because he knows.

387
00:21:13,835 --> 00:21:19,115
Now we're going to set
a that gamma b, not a,

388
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:24,890
and B on this side is not a,

389
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,540
not a and B.

390
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,745
So I've got the same
thing on each side.

391
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,760
So then I bring that gamma
roll away round here,

392
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:38,705
find a and B

393
00:21:38,705 --> 00:21:44,000
entails a, O, B.

394
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,625
And once we have those
two, we can just say,

395
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,070
if I choose this one for gamma,

396
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,825
then this is obviously true.

397
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:54,290
And now I can come around
and derive this much,

398
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,775
this one for gamma,

399
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,055
then this is obviously true.

400
00:21:58,055 --> 00:21:59,900
And I can go around
here, improve that.

401
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,450
That's putting on the
two groups together.

402
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,230
So then at the end they are
both a subset of each other.

403
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,090
So at the end about
this opposite of

404
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:10,355
each other and we've shown
that Bogan's LO, Yes.

405
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:11,750
One last question is When we

406
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,450
arrived that this two are equal.

407
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,620
But graduates, like at last
I have not parenthesis,

408
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,170
not a or not b equal

409
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,590
to a and b to kind of
add and not, again,

410
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:32,510
suppose i to make it this n
to the n. And so at the end,

411
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,465
I have these two
equal to each other.

412
00:22:35,465 --> 00:22:41,105
But the thing I have
not parentheses.

413
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:46,970
I got no parenthesis
a and B equals to o.

414
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:53,060
The rabbit is a and B is
equal to NOT parenthesis,

415
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,500
not a or not b.

416
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,645
Well, n equals not,

417
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:03,860
not a or not b.

418
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,525
That's what you're talking about.

419
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:07,920
Yes. Just like can we add or

420
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,280
not at both sides
to make it back?

421
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,280
It should look like, like you

422
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,370
can add a to both sides
and this one cancels out.

423
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,050
So we can do that
because I was not

424
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,520
sure if we can I can
tell you that you're

425
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,035
actually going out to

426
00:23:21,035 --> 00:23:23,900
the sides and then and then
these two naughts cancel out.

427
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,510
So you get that. Okay. Thank you.

428
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,325
I think that's all my questions.

429
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:31,820
But what I was saying here is
you're going to this tweak,

430
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,675
just learn to do it is
with and, and or not.

431
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,745
Once we have this method,

432
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:41,420
we will then extend it to
do other connectives like

433
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,820
implication and X0 and

434
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,830
all the other things you
may have learned about.

435
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,095
You did some Boolean
algebra before.

436
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:50,900
And you will find that
we can these bricks

437
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,649
the reduction with all the
different correctives.

438
00:23:54,649 --> 00:23:56,255
So we will give you

439
00:23:56,255 --> 00:23:59,600
Saturday after you've
submitted your work on this,

440
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,225
will actually give you some
more things to discuss.

441
00:24:02,225 --> 00:24:04,940
The tutorial that will change

442
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,790
the tutorial slightly for
this week in the sense that

443
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,440
going to give you some work to

444
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,180
do which we haven't seen or at

445
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,890
least you haven't submitted

446
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,960
your work on it
before the tutorial,

447
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,390
that you can work in
tutorial and then for

448
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:20,195
the next week's tutorial
of pre-prepared.

449
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:22,850
So I'll be interested
to see how you think

450
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,445
that we're Does anyone
have more questions?

451
00:24:25,445 --> 00:24:26,720
I see they're asking us

452
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,540
how gamma ray Altera
just generic sets.

453
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,670
Amaranth delta can be anything.

454
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:35,495
So it allows you to generalize
your argument because

455
00:24:35,495 --> 00:24:40,175
gamma and delta can be
any sets of predicates.

456
00:24:40,175 --> 00:24:43,205
And as we saw with that
trick, I just paid.

457
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:46,745
Then by substituting one
thing in for gamma or rather,

458
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:48,230
I can actually make use of

459
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,350
the same chain reasoning
different ways.

460
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,390
That was a good example for that.

461
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,830
Then what I would ask
you is your tents of

462
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,450
the past in terms of two things.

463
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:07,130
Firstly, difficulty, was
that reasonably okay?

464
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,050
I I want it to be so

465
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:11,420
easy that you think
wasn't worth taking.

466
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,095
I want it to be not so
hard that you think,

467
00:25:15,095 --> 00:25:17,480
gosh, it's totally impossible.

468
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,220
So I'd like a three out
of the four questions,

469
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,785
was everyone reasonably
happy that they should

470
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:28,370
they should be able to do
it in terms of timing,

471
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,470
Did you feel very rushed or

472
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,895
a little bit rushed
or just about?

473
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:35,710
If you want to, you
can gave answers to

474
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,715
those questions
anonymously, yachts,

475
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:42,910
but still be very
helpful to us to

476
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:47,440
hear how you felt it was
him in terms of difficulty,

477
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,970
in terms of timing.

478
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,950
And the final thing
is I know that

479
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,255
some people had difficulties
with submission.

480
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:57,130
And we're going to try
and deal with this,

481
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,755
as we said with the with
the emails that came in,

482
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:03,730
we weren't able to answer all
your emails individually,

483
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,680
beverage as so many of them.

484
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,620
How many of you that we will try

485
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,170
and get every cancers
once we've worked out

486
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,710
what's happening at
any one thiol to

487
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,500
submit at all in
including my email,

488
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,375
if other things failed,

489
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:24,770
rushed anymore questions
in a renown poll?

490
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:26,840
Questions, that's fine.

491
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,570
We will have the
session on Monday

492
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,995
again and have a good weekend.

493
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:36,800
Make sure you get some respite.

494
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,010
Get your submissions in.

495
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:42,770
I'm or even before
time as soon as you

496
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,730
can tell the tutorial site to
just have those submitted.

497
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,335
And then I can I will
see you on Monday.

498
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:53,570
Thank you very much.
Indeed. I'm going

499
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,190
to leave now. Thank you.
