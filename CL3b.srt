1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,835
We say every ISP

2
00:00:02,835 --> 00:00:05,369
as just what we mean by
that first turnstile,

3
00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:08,595
we will look at it
in a Venn diagram.

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:12,000
Then that means that
there's nothing in here.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
Things in, there would be
things that are a but not B.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,660
And if every a is B,

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,390
then there can't be
anything in here.

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,930
If I take the negation of that,

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,365
that is to say, if there
is something in here,

10
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:29,760
which I pictured down here with a

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,919
green represented gets inhabited,

12
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,320
then that means some a is not B,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,810
which corresponds to saying
the negation of this thing.

14
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,774
It's not the case that every ISP,

15
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:43,070
that means it is the case
that somebody is not

16
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,370
p. If we look at this one,

17
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,565
this says, no a is B.

18
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,410
It's not the case that there is

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:54,005
anything which is both a and B.

20
00:00:54,005 --> 00:00:56,400
So that's empty.

21
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,600
And here we say it is

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,630
the case that there is something
which is both a and B.

23
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,255
That's some a is b.

24
00:01:05,255 --> 00:01:07,340
And you have to think
of it just to try

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,560
and get these things
in your head.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,100
So it's useful to
have these notations.

27
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:19,265
We saw the object level
control positions.

28
00:01:19,265 --> 00:01:21,680
That's the compositions
on either side of

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,490
the turnstile where we had the
turnstile without the not.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,260
But if you just think of it,

31
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,020
these contour position's
work just as well.

32
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:35,645
If we take the NOX as if we
take the direct turnstiles.

33
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,060
You see you do nowadays when we,

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,550
when we do it on
concrete examples

35
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:44,000
like everyone on that side
of the room as a man,

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,460
you, you can see
now, it's not true.

37
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,855
What's it mean to
say it's not true?

38
00:01:47,855 --> 00:01:49,145
It means there were
some women that

39
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,420
you need to be able to take

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,690
that and translate
it into symbols.

41
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,110
And the reason we want to
translate it into symbols,

42
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,410
then we can write
down rules like this.

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,454
That a much simpler
than trying to remember

44
00:02:03,454 --> 00:02:06,379
complicated expressions
in English language,

45
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,360
which would amount to
saying the same thing

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,850
or in Greek or whatever
language you happen to have.

47
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:12,320
This language is nice

48
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,140
because we can
manipulate it easily.

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,149
It structurally very simple.

50
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:18,875
It's unambiguous.

51
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:23,970
Its logic. You'll
learn to love it.
