1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,130
We're going to change
the subject now to do

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,735
something that's no longer
back in Aristotle's time.

3
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,275
But that it is due to blow,

4
00:00:13,275 --> 00:00:18,510
who lived in the 19th
century of an American PS,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,770
who's very little known in
the UK because he's American,

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,010
but actually did an
awful lot to sort out

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,960
those ideas and make them

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,255
much clearer and
easier to deal with.

9
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:32,670
Then Jensen, who worked on

10
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:35,385
the rules that we will
be looking at today.

11
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:39,140
Jensen, change the way
we write these rules.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,210
We started with the idea

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:44,990
every a is B just means
a is contained in B.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:48,950
Sometimes we wrote
a comma b satisfy

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:52,985
C. And that means if
a and B then C here,

16
00:00:52,985 --> 00:00:55,355
let's look at a little inference.

17
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:59,870
C satisfies IOP, then no,

18
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,540
AOB satisfies Nazi,
that's contraposition.

19
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,370
Then if we know de Morgan,

20
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,985
we say, this is the same as that.

21
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,840
But then that's the same
as having these two

22
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,150
separately because the comma

23
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,595
on the left just
counts as an end.

24
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:21,290
Because we interpret
this as saying,

25
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,140
if this is true and this
is true, then that's true.

26
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,775
If I have this.

27
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:32,480
And for a moment, I
changed the rules and say,

28
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,950
instead of doing
a contraposition,

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,450
that just lets me move one thing

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,490
across and one thing back.

31
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,370
I'll move both of these
across and change their sign.

32
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,830
And I'll move this one
back and change its sign.

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,455
That I get two
things on the right.

34
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,930
And what do those two
things on the right mean?

35
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,325
Well, if we look here,

36
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:53,285
it means a calmer on the
right corresponds to an OR.

37
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:55,070
It's the game we'll play will

38
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:58,475
make sequence they're called,

39
00:01:58,475 --> 00:02:01,279
which are just like our
normal satisfaction,

40
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:02,750
except we can have
a finite number

41
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,250
of things on the left and

42
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,554
a finite number of things on
the right and on the left.

43
00:02:08,554 --> 00:02:10,145
When we write the calmer,

44
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:12,185
you think of it as end.

45
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:14,105
And on the right
you think of it is,

46
00:02:14,105 --> 00:02:16,685
or what the sequence says is,

47
00:02:16,685 --> 00:02:19,490
if all the things on
the left are true,

48
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,920
then at least one of the
things on the right is true.
