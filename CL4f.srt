1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
Let's look at the
rules we've got.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to take these
rules and make use of them.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,330
We have those roles
that we had here,

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,730
which are just the rules
we've already played with.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,845
But now we're going to
play a different game.

6
00:00:13,845 --> 00:00:18,495
We're going to say we have a
sequent, which is satisfied.

7
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:25,515
If whenever everything
on the left is true,

8
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:29,070
then something on
the right is true.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,590
Okay? So we're thinking still

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,740
of predicates that are
about individuals.

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,135
And if any individual has
all of these properties,

12
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,190
that it has at least one
of these properties.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,425
And that's a picture of Gensler.

14
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:47,435
Again, since a very sad case,

15
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:50,030
he joined the Nazis at
the end of the war.

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,170
He was in a prisoner camp.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,510
I'm with maltreated
enough so that he

18
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,270
died of starvation,
which is a pity.

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,620
I mean, it's a pretty
joined the Nazis.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,780
It's pretty terrible
story sequence.

21
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,030
Or whenever every
antecedent holds,

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,815
some succeed and holes.

23
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,520
If we want to write
that in Haskell,

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,275
and we will at some stage,

25
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:10,520
we have to do it like this.

26
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,530
I'm not going to go through this

27
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,020
now I leave you to
ponder over that.

28
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,809
It says for every thing,

29
00:01:17,809 --> 00:01:21,680
so that's and X from things.

30
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,600
If everything gamma G is true,

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,915
so that's the end Over
the Gs from gamma.

32
00:01:29,915 --> 00:01:33,350
Then something in delta is true.

33
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,990
That's an or of the D's in delta.

34
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,350
Gamma corresponds to
the capital G in Greek,

35
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,900
and that's a delta
corresponding to a

36
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,910
D. And it's just

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,700
traditional to use
those for these things.

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,325
Writing it in symbols that

39
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,800
satisfaction is defined in

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,380
terms of one with
just one predicate.

41
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,595
I can take the end of
all the things in gamma.

42
00:01:58,595 --> 00:02:00,320
That's a single predicate as

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,065
sets, that's just intersection.

44
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:07,235
And this is the or of
all the things delta.

45
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:09,080
That's again a predicate,

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,130
which is the union as the
sets we started with,

47
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,915
All a is B,

48
00:02:14,915 --> 00:02:18,230
which means that the gray part of

49
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,475
that Venn diagram is empty.

50
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,094
What does it mean?

51
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:29,210
If I say G comma a satisfies B.

52
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:32,105
And instead of drawing
another circle,

53
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:33,380
which would divide University

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,865
to provide it with
a straight line.

55
00:02:34,865 --> 00:02:39,305
The places where G is true
above that green line,

56
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:43,520
and the places where G is
false below that green line,

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,790
we're reaching j
comma a is G and a.

58
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,950
But I want you to
think we've done

59
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,145
slightly differently if
I take any universe.

60
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:53,570
So I've got a
collection of things

61
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,475
and I have some
properties on them.

62
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:59,030
And then I throw some
of the things away.

63
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,620
I've still got the properties on

64
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,675
the things that I
haven't thrown away.

65
00:03:02,675 --> 00:03:05,210
So I can always take a
sub universe and that's

66
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,255
a perfectly good Universe
to be working in.

67
00:03:08,255 --> 00:03:11,735
So what happens here is that

68
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:18,030
this is valid in
this whole universe.

69
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,040
If this is valid in the parts of

70
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,150
the universe that satisfies
g. In other words,

71
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,505
this area which is G
and a colored grey.

72
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:33,905
And we don't care what
happens out here.

73
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:36,665
Once we have this G here,

74
00:03:36,665 --> 00:03:38,750
we're only interested in
what goes on in here.

75
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,750
So we can interpret this
as just saying, oh, well,

76
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,400
it really means this is valid

77
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,785
in a smaller universe.
Namely that one.

78
00:03:45,785 --> 00:03:49,340
The same happens if we
take lots of things.

79
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,934
I can replace gamma.

80
00:03:51,934 --> 00:03:55,040
By the end of all
the things in gamma.

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,750
I made the diagram look the same.

82
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,430
Of course, if there's more
things that you might

83
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,185
have got smaller, you
couldn't have got bigger.

84
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:04,235
This is the things that
satisfy everything in gamma.

85
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:10,040
Gamma comma a satisfies
B is valid in you.

86
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,095
That's this big universe.

87
00:04:12,095 --> 00:04:16,475
If this thing we originally
started with Aristotle.

88
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:19,490
If every a is b inside

89
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:21,545
the collection of things

90
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,050
that satisfy everything in gamma,

91
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,675
this is the universe
of those things which

92
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:30,095
every G in gamma is true.

93
00:04:30,095 --> 00:04:33,020
So actually when we
write the chromosomal f,

94
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,060
instead of thinking It
says this and this,

95
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,320
we can always think of it in

96
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,645
some small universe where
these things are true,

97
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,435
focused on one thing
we're working on the a.

98
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,820
So we can think in a
smaller universe where

99
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:47,490
all of these are
true. I satisfies B.
