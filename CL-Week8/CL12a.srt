1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,420
Order orderings are very
important in computer science.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,414
You may have seen
these orderings.

3
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,770
So this is 0, is less than one,

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,405
false is less than true.

5
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:15,130
These are the subsets
of a singleton set.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,200
These are the subsets of
a set with two elements.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,275
These are the subsets of a
set with three elements.

8
00:00:21,275 --> 00:00:24,305
And these are the subsets of
a set with four elements.

9
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:25,730
When you're looking
at Karnaugh maps,

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,160
you're looking at
subsets of 16 things.

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,210
And if you try and even draw

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,225
the next hypercube above
these upsets a four things.

13
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:33,380
It just gets so messy.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,180
You can't see it's a
hypercube anymore.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,950
Orderings very important in

16
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:39,635
computing the question
of information.

17
00:00:39,635 --> 00:00:42,080
We've, we have more
information coming in.

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,225
We can have more
information going out.

19
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:45,815
You will see those ideas

20
00:00:45,815 --> 00:00:47,465
a lot as you go
through the course.

21
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:49,640
Here we're just going to
look at the ordering as

22
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,770
it regards our current topics.

23
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,665
The ordering a less
than or equal to b,

24
00:00:54,665 --> 00:00:57,545
which we were looking at when
we looked at satisfaction,

25
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,040
it corresponds to a
implies B being true.

26
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,659
If we look at two variables,

27
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:04,640
this one can be false or true.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,940
That's a, this one could be
false or true, that's B.

29
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,995
Then when this one a is less
than or equal to this one,

30
00:01:12,995 --> 00:01:15,260
that is in these three cases than

31
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,600
the implication is true.
Otherwise it's not.

32
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,910
If we look again at
that hypercube of

33
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,295
the subsets of four things,

34
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:23,900
then here we have four things,

35
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,900
any one of which may be
either in or not in.

36
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,310
So I put the ones that are in

37
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,730
as green and the ones
that are not in as red.

38
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,820
Okay, so we've got it's whatever

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,645
predicate is false down here.

40
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,285
Of all four things
in our universe.

41
00:01:41,285 --> 00:01:43,970
This is true of all four
things in our universe,

42
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,175
and these are the other
possible predicates

43
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:48,245
on a universe of four things.

44
00:01:48,245 --> 00:01:50,030
We can identify some of these

45
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,890
if we think of the predicate a as

46
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,985
being true on the bottom row
and falls on the top row.

47
00:01:55,985 --> 00:02:00,680
And the predicate be as being
false here and true there,

48
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,320
then I think that will
correspond to what I have here.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,260
This is not a or not b.

50
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,695
So not a is this top row,

51
00:02:09,695 --> 00:02:11,570
not b is that first column.

52
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,135
This of course is
just everywhere true.

53
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:17,030
This is not a or b.

54
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,010
So we can write down
an expression for

55
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,830
every single one of
these things is not a.

56
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,345
This one here is the
exclusive OR of a and B.

57
00:02:26,345 --> 00:02:27,575
One of them is true,

58
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:28,970
but not both of them are true.

59
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,980
And if we look at this
diagram now we can see

60
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,350
these arrows correspond
to implications.

61
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,365
So it's true that if a x or b,

62
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:39,800
then a or not b is true, right?

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,115
So this arrow corresponds to
the truth of an implication.

64
00:02:43,115 --> 00:02:44,795
All of these arrows do.

65
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,130
In the original cube.

66
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,345
I didn't have arrows,

67
00:02:47,345 --> 00:02:49,220
but now the ordering
is making a difference

68
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,335
because set is the empty set
is smaller than this set,

69
00:02:54,335 --> 00:02:55,520
which is a singleton.

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,650
In fact, we have for singletons,

71
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,790
this one, this one,

72
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,860
this one, and this one.

73
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,265
And the empty set is
less than all of them.

74
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07,880
But these two are less than
this one which is doubled.

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,190
And there are two states
that are in there.

76
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,730
This implication is just the
containment relation that

77
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,390
we started off with when we
were looking at syllogisms,

78
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:20,180
we get these cube sitting
inside the hypercube.

79
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,205
And the hypercube is
basically made up

80
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:24,725
of a number of those
cubes locking together.

81
00:03:24,725 --> 00:03:31,430
And not B implies a x obey and
IX OP implies A0 not flow.

82
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,440
If I take things out
of the hypercube,

83
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,000
imagine we're now sitting inside

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,320
a much bigger hypercube with

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,940
as many variables as we like,

86
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,620
but we can only look
at little bits of it.

87
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,909
So if I have a proposition,

88
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,470
x and I have a proposition,

89
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,170
why think of them as
subsets of a set X or

90
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:48,545
Y will be bigger
than both x and y,

91
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:53,225
and x and y will be
smaller than both x and y.

92
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,430
And in fact, this is

93
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:58,820
the smallest thing that is
bigger than both of these.

94
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,635
And this is the biggest thing

95
00:04:00,635 --> 00:04:02,255
that is smaller
than both of those.

96
00:04:02,255 --> 00:04:05,180
Suppose I interpret
some propositions,

97
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,160
then if these propositions set

98
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,665
like this with this
arrow going up,

99
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:13,010
then it's true that this
one implies this one,

100
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,780
this one implies that one,

101
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,910
this one implies
that one, and so on.

102
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,290
Now, we're going to look at

103
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,515
the very simplest
cases of satisfaction.

104
00:04:21,515 --> 00:04:25,489
That is, satisfaction for
conjunctions of clauses,

105
00:04:25,489 --> 00:04:28,925
where each clause has
at most two literals.

106
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:31,700
So what's a clause with two
literals are like, well,

107
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,545
it's either a or b,

108
00:04:33,545 --> 00:04:37,700
not b, not a or not
B or not a or B.

109
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,260
If I just take two atoms,

110
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,555
a and B, I make
notes for Clausius.

111
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,580
What's that got to
do with arrows?

112
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,830
Here? I'm just going to
look at two things with

113
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:48,215
arrows, a implies b.

114
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:51,260
So if I manage to
interpret those things in

115
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,905
a universe so that a
implies b is true,

116
00:04:54,905 --> 00:04:59,120
then it means that B contains
more things than aid us.

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,665
Every state that's in a is
in B allowed states that are

118
00:05:03,665 --> 00:05:06,170
neither in a NOR NB were

119
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,275
allowed states that are
neither in a or in B,

120
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:10,880
in B but not in a.

121
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,600
And in both of them, if a
implies b is true and I'm in

122
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,355
a state where a is true

123
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,575
and I must be in a
state where p is true.

124
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,585
So if I've made a true

125
00:05:20,585 --> 00:05:22,835
than anything above,
it must be true.

126
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:25,100
Because if this
implication is true

127
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,560
than the set where a is true
is contained in the set,

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,925
whether things above it true.

129
00:05:28,925 --> 00:05:33,080
So this ordering tells me
what valuations I can have.

130
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,790
I can't have the valuation
that makes a true and b false.

131
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:41,015
These lines I've drawn
a meant to be pictures.

132
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:42,980
I've drawn the line
between true and

133
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,035
false. What does that mean?

134
00:05:45,035 --> 00:05:46,700
Drawing the line
between true and we

135
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,440
go back to this diagram,

136
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,950
then I consider the states
that make this true,

137
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,900
and then they certainly make that

138
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,000
true because this is
contained in that.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,145
So I can draw a
line here and say,

140
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:00,110
I'm only thinking of states

141
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,105
where all three of
these are true.

142
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:05,195
Or draw a line here and say,

143
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:07,850
I can make all of
these things is true,

144
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,710
but not anything below.

145
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,510
I can make all of
these things true.

146
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,340
Because if I make these two true,

147
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,665
then I make that true and
that true and not true,

148
00:06:15,665 --> 00:06:17,300
and I make nothing below true.

149
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,805
Thinking of particular
valuations allows me to say,

150
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,020
if I make this thing true,

151
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,580
I make all things above it true.

152
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,965
That means I can draw
a line across saying,

153
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:30,500
how do I separate the
things above which a

154
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,185
true from the things
below which are false.

155
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:35,240
So this is a line
that says everything

156
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,430
below here is false,

157
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,560
and everything
above here is true.

158
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,645
That's what the green
is meant to symbolise.

159
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:46,820
I can make this arrow
valid if I draw

160
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,075
a line here and make
everything above their

161
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,875
true and everything
below their false.

162
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,645
I can also make it valid.

163
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:55,190
If I make everything above here

164
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,175
true and everything
below their false,

165
00:06:58,175 --> 00:07:01,400
because I make a false and
b true and that's okay.

166
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,625
Or I can make everything
above here true,

167
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,200
everything below here false.

168
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,895
That says I make them all false.

169
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,505
And again, a implies b is true.

170
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,470
So just three ways of doing it.

171
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,970
We can pick them up
from the diagram.
