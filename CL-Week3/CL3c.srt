1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,295
So these are Aristotle's
categorical propositions

2
00:00:05,295 --> 00:00:07,305
as the all ISP,

3
00:00:07,305 --> 00:00:10,620
where we say there
is nothing that is

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,135
a and not p grave
it is not really.

5
00:00:15,135 --> 00:00:16,560
So there's nothing like that.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,005
In other words, all a is b.

7
00:00:19,005 --> 00:00:23,250
Here. We say there's nothing
that's both a and B.

8
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,945
That means no a is B,

9
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:29,345
which is the same as
every egg is not b.

10
00:00:29,345 --> 00:00:32,960
This is the negation of that.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,750
Because saying there's
nothing in here to say that's

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,330
not true is to say there
is something in here.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,790
This is the negation of this to

14
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,200
say there's nothing in

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,375
here and there's
something in here.

16
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:50,675
So these are some a is b and
this is sum a is not re,

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,360
just by the way, we made them.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,985
The things diagonally opposite

19
00:00:55,985 --> 00:00:59,070
our contradictions of each other.

20
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:04,640
So this is every area

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,060
is B and this is
that does not hold.

22
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,835
It's not the case that every ISP,

23
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:13,730
this is every eye is not B,

24
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:19,020
and this is that does
not hold some ISP.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,325
Could you find a way of saying

26
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,860
each of those in your language?

27
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,750
But it's not ambiguous.

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,285
It's actually quite
hard in English

29
00:01:29,285 --> 00:01:31,910
to find something that says

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,800
these simply and precisely
without people saying,

31
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,480
well, what does that really mean?

32
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,190
And if you put it inside
another sentence,

33
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,750
It might be taken differently.

34
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,610
Try doing that in your language.

35
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,930
You say you've got it straight.
