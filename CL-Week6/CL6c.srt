1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
Now we're going to do a little
bit of logic. We're ready.

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:05,580
We call pictures that aside to

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,950
remind us what swear
it actually help.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,150
Instead of looking here and

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,680
trying to get through
the encoding,

6
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,480
it just helps to
think employers on,

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,325
that's what's there.
That means blue zone.

8
00:00:14,325 --> 00:00:17,969
If I say green and blue,

9
00:00:17,969 --> 00:00:20,280
it's the intersection
of these two.

10
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,130
So green and blue eyed ones in

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,010
here where green is
true and blue is true.

12
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,420
Here's another block, there's

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,370
a block of ones showing me the

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,900
green and blue are true
for each of these letters.

15
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,500
This is a block of ones
showing that a is true.

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,030
This is a block of peace,

17
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,145
showing that P is true.
Block, block green.

18
00:00:43,145 --> 00:00:44,480
We'd have a block for naught.

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,790
A will have a block for Nora.

20
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,690
And we'd have to
think about blocks

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:53,030
for not green and not blue.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,175
We'll come back to
that. If I try.

23
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:57,560
Not a and B again

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,305
get a similar kind of block.
Does everyone get that?

25
00:01:00,305 --> 00:01:03,260
Does everyone see
node a and b naught

26
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:06,140
a is this side and b,
so we intersect them.

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,545
So we get that block,
not a and not r.

28
00:01:09,545 --> 00:01:13,745
So not a is this left hand
side now is this topic.

29
00:01:13,745 --> 00:01:15,170
So not a and not a is

30
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,260
the not B and not.
We see another blow.

31
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,605
Anyone i, any idea what's
special about blocks now?

32
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:23,540
G and no TAA.

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,130
Where we get to this place

34
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,710
where if we're going
to make sense of this,

35
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,715
we've got to think of those
as being next to each other.

36
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:34,820
For doing that, let's
make a picture.

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,520
Here. I've taken
our 16 states and

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,550
out here I've got copies
of that same thing.

39
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,715
But we can put them
together like this.

40
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:46,190
Now, you can't see the edges.

41
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,660
What I've done is to take

42
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,485
multiple copies and just put
them next to each other.

43
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:54,335
So the rules how along this row,

44
00:01:54,335 --> 00:01:57,815
we've just got reds down here.

45
00:01:57,815 --> 00:02:00,920
What we got, we've
got neither this nor

46
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,280
that down any row
along any column.

47
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,355
We've got something
that's constant.

48
00:02:07,355 --> 00:02:09,305
Namely the, here're
two things around

49
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,035
changing and the
other two can change.

50
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:13,940
And every time I go
from one to another,

51
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,110
I changed one thing.

52
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,025
So I can change this
nothing to amber or red,

53
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:21,215
or green or blue.

54
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:24,110
You can see why you do this in

55
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,710
two dimensions for
four variables.

56
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,350
But if you wanted
to six variables,

57
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,180
you have to go into
three dimensions.

58
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,220
And it's much harder
to see when you've got

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,055
a solid cube that's
colored, you go through it.

60
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,450
So some people can do that,

61
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,970
but I'm not gonna do that
with you in this course.
