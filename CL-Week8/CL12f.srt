1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Uh-huh. What's more complicated
about this example?

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,210
What do we do when
we see an example?

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:09,390
We first cheque whether
there's a repeated datum.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,835
We got Bay and
that's the only one.

5
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:13,380
So what's the rule now,

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,435
any line we draw has to
go between not B and B.

7
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,815
And it will have to go,

8
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,360
even if not p was above NP

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,335
was beloved still
have to go between.

10
00:00:23,335 --> 00:00:25,235
So it has to go between.

11
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:26,570
And that actually simplifies

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,280
the problem provided
you notice it,

13
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,040
because it means you put zeros on

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,160
the things that don't
go between the two BCE.

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,335
So this is like
what we did before,

16
00:00:36,335 --> 00:00:39,050
except that we now have a 0 up

17
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,840
here and a 0 down here,
because they're not legal.

18
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,505
We count these three,

19
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,455
that uses two 3's here,

20
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:47,900
a one here, that gives
us the seven there,

21
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,310
but we only have
two ways of getting

22
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,170
out with seven, that's 14.

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,960
And then again, this problem
has two lattices missing.

24
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,105
So it's 14 times 2X squared.

25
00:00:56,105 --> 00:00:57,320
There were two letters missing.

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,435
So instead of multiplying by two,

27
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,895
we multiply by two twice.

28
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,550
Here's another example
where we see that we get

29
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:08,135
the same result whichever
way we approach problems.

30
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:09,800
Let's go back just to

31
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,225
this learning. Take
a minute or two.

32
00:01:11,225 --> 00:01:13,370
We have now our original problem.

33
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,000
We've got a mixture of B's,

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,370
not B's and A's and nowadays,

35
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,750
so we're going to
put everything and

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,250
we're going to draw
the whole thing.

37
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:26,000
So we'll do both the
B's and C's and B's.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,525
And so I've John that diagram.

39
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:30,890
And frankly, this is

40
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,510
difficult to do with
pencil and paper.

41
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,580
It's actually easier
to do on the machine.

42
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,620
Cuz I can drag things
around and align,

43
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,090
stay together and you can play,

44
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:39,950
but we will draw the diagram.

45
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,575
This is more complicated than
I would expect you to do,

46
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:44,330
but it's fun to play

47
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,745
pulling things around a
bit from that diagram.

48
00:01:46,745 --> 00:01:48,425
We get to this diagram.

49
00:01:48,425 --> 00:01:50,615
By the time we've caused
it to this diagram,

50
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:52,475
you can work it out.

51
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,430
One consequence of the
arrow rules that I

52
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,045
haven't talked about is
that if we have a cycle,

53
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,590
then I can never draw a line

54
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,450
through that cycle
because if I did,

55
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,830
it would cut one error one

56
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,810
way and one arrow another ways.

57
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,625
You can never cut
through a cycle.

58
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,080
Either we gotta be

59
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,660
completely below that
or completely above it.

60
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,085
Similarly with this cycle,

61
00:02:13,085 --> 00:02:17,570
we've also got the D.
We have to go between

62
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:23,200
d not d. So I can't
do a line down here.

63
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,865
If I come in here,

64
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:30,265
I have to go out above
D and I can't come out.

65
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:34,000
They're somehow because that

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,460
would make that would make
this one go the wrong way.

67
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,250
So we have to come out
above the, so in fact,

68
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,880
for this example is simply
that one and that one.

69
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,000
So there are only two
possibilities for the courses

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,605
you can take with those rules

71
00:02:47,605 --> 00:02:49,420
that I mentioned
at the beginning.

72
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,195
Some ways that it's just a toy.

73
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:55,030
But it's, it's actually
a fact that problems,

74
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,820
that can be phrased
as 2-SAT problems

75
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:00,730
where every clause
is a binary clause,

76
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,880
can be solved in polynomial time.

77
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,095
Whereas the moment you get
to three SAT problems,

78
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:08,660
then that NP-complete there among

79
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,940
the hardest problems,
we know there,

80
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,220
as hard as all the
other hard problems,

81
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,880
satisfiability is
really a key point.

82
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,430
And the, if you look
at what happens with

83
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:23,780
unit propagation in
the, in the, the PLL,

84
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,235
what it's doing is when things
are down to two literals,

85
00:03:28,235 --> 00:03:31,550
then it creating unit clauses
and propagating them.

86
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,110
And doing that efficiently.

87
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,235
So it's taking the,

88
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:36,170
the easy bits of the problem and

89
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:38,030
doing it efficiently
and then leaving

90
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,040
the heartbeats
isolated rather than

91
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,380
treating the easy bits in the
same way as the heartbeats.
