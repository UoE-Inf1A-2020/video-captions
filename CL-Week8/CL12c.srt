1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
What we're going to do
next is we have a diagram.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,579
We draw a line and that
gives us evaluation.

3
00:00:05,579 --> 00:00:07,260
The line we draw has to be such.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,020
It doesn't break any of
these rules. We couldn't.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,504
Here are some arrows.

6
00:00:11,504 --> 00:00:13,560
The arrows either stay on

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,670
the same side of the line
or cross it upwards.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:19,035
And then other valid,

9
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:21,075
This one here is not valid.

10
00:00:21,075 --> 00:00:24,360
For a valid this one
isn't, as I've said there.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,340
So the valuation
makes the implication

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,370
true unless the arrow
goes from true to false.

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:33,900
We can also, of course have
things like Not the arrows,

14
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,075
not a, but interestingly,

15
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:39,565
because the deer on
other sides of the line,

16
00:00:39,565 --> 00:00:41,780
not the arrow is not a and

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,375
not a and a are on other
sides of the line.

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,935
Not D or not a actually
corresponds to also that arrow.

19
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,290
So if one of these
arrows is valid

20
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,825
for an implication
than the other one is,

21
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:56,390
this is exactly what
contraposition is about.

22
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,460
Contraposition puts each thing

23
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,825
on the other side of the line.

24
00:00:59,825 --> 00:01:01,430
Because when you
negate something,

25
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,140
you move it from being

26
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,435
true to false and
being false to true.

27
00:01:05,435 --> 00:01:09,335
So it doesn't matter which one
of these arrows we put in.

28
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,610
It has the same force.

29
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,810
But when we put things together,

30
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,100
you'll find that sometimes

31
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,330
you need to put both of them in.

32
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,570
It doesn't matter which way
we represent the fact that

33
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:22,280
not a or D nausea ODE
corresponds to a implies D,

34
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,865
but it also corresponds
to not the implies not a.

35
00:01:25,865 --> 00:01:27,200
And the rule will be the same

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,775
no matter which way we drew them.

37
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:31,715
We can't have arrows
going from top to bottom.

38
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:33,080
And this is just showing how

39
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,810
the contraposition
works in various ways.

40
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,820
Contraposition works here in

41
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,680
the way that I just indicated.

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,170
But if I have something
up here than it is

43
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,360
contraposition down the bottom

44
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,505
is also completely
down the bottom.

45
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:49,805
So contraposition works
fine with this rule.

46
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:52,625
So this gives us three
possible valuations.

47
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:55,730
Suppose I extend this
diagram and I say,

48
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,350
not only does a
arrow B be arrows c,

49
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,150
c would be another stage

50
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,920
and true would have
to move further up.

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,710
We put false at the
bottom and true at

52
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,210
the top just to remind ourselves

53
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,175
which way the diagrams going.

54
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:13,055
Of course, we can
never make true false.

55
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:14,720
So we can't put
our line above the

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,120
true and we never
make false true.

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,410
So we never put our line below

58
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,910
the false airline has to

59
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,515
cut somewhere between
true and false.

60
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:26,120
Suppose I put an extra
arrow in here from B to C,

61
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,635
and then from C to true,

62
00:02:27,635 --> 00:02:31,145
how many valuations could
I make that would make

63
00:02:31,145 --> 00:02:35,810
both a implies b and
b implies c valid?

64
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:38,540
Draw the diagram or
in your mind's eye,

65
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,655
draw the diagram.
Let's try and draw it.

66
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,350
Let's pretend this is

67
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,235
a c true up there and
we'll put an arrow there.

68
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:49,055
How many more
valuations do I get?

69
00:02:49,055 --> 00:02:50,540
This valuation makes a,

70
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,770
b, and c true.

71
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,100
So certainly a is
true and B is true.

72
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,780
So a implies b is true,

73
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,670
and B is true and C is true.

74
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,900
So be inside, c is true.

75
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,610
So this valuation slow works.

76
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,560
This one still works.

77
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,555
A is false, B is true,

78
00:03:05,555 --> 00:03:06,740
and B and C are both true.

79
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,870
So it's fine that
valuation works.

80
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,390
The only evaluation we
didn't have this this one.

81
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,295
So there's one more valuation,

82
00:03:13,295 --> 00:03:16,805
which is I can either
make c true or false.

83
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:18,425
If I make B true,

84
00:03:18,425 --> 00:03:19,490
I have to make c true.

85
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,400
If I make a true, I have
to make B and C True.

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,440
But when I make the
other two false,

87
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,380
I can either may see
true or makes a false.

88
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:30,920
So we get for evaluation 1234,

89
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,870
there are 26 letters
in the alphabet.

90
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,415
Suppose I have a implies
B implies C, and so on.

91
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,775
All the way to X
implies Y implies said,

92
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:43,520
how many valuations make all

93
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,070
of those 25 arrows connecting

94
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:49,250
the 26 letters of the alphabet in

95
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,585
a line says 26 letters the
alphabet, there's 25 arrows.

96
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:55,445
How many cuts can I make?

97
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:56,690
There are two extra arrows.

98
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,490
One that comes from false to a,

99
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,340
and one that comes
from zed to true.

100
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,715
So that's 25, arrow
is plus two is 27.

101
00:04:04,715 --> 00:04:07,190
If we have a chain of
implications like that,

102
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,390
we've now worked that out.

103
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,040
If you thought about
it for a little while,

104
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,600
you would've got to that answer.

105
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,780
If I have any chain of
implications going up,

106
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,020
then I can cut in any
one of these gaps.

107
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,535
Anyone of those cuts will work.

108
00:04:19,535 --> 00:04:23,495
You've got 12345 for that
example, possible valuations.

109
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:25,279
So if we had this problem,

110
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,585
which is this problem,

111
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,535
we draw that diagram.

112
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:30,620
So we have a chain of N things.

113
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,920
We get n plus one valuations.
