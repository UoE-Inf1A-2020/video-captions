1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:07,650
Now I want you to

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:12,585
draw in your minds or a piece
of paper in front of you.

3
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,730
One of these tiny Venn diagrams

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,860
that just has two predicates,

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,220
a and b, and it's a Venn
diagram so they overlap,

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,980
they know inside each
other just a and b.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,190
And I want you to think

8
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:32,940
about what we might
say about a and B.

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,690
You can fill in a and b on
a Venn diagram, can't you?

10
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:41,605
So think of the relationship.

11
00:00:41,605 --> 00:00:45,230
Everything in C. So draw a,

12
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:51,785
C such that everything
in C is in a and B.

13
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,530
So you've got your IMB.

14
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:59,615
You're going to introduce
see somewhere such that.

15
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:01,130
And now it's going to
be an Euler diagram,

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,150
not a Venn diagram because

17
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:04,910
this new one comes in somewhere.

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,820
And I want it to be
such that everything in

19
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:11,510
C is in both a and

20
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:19,580
B. I hope you've drawn a
diagram, something like that.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:26,250
So here we have a at the bottom.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,545
As a, there's B.

23
00:01:30,545 --> 00:01:33,320
And I asked you to draw something

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,025
that was contained in a and B.

25
00:01:37,025 --> 00:01:39,125
So I hope you drew
something like that.

26
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:40,610
I should have done this without

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,470
putting a picture in the video.

28
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,330
Because I want not only to

29
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:46,265
train you to draw these pictures,

30
00:01:46,265 --> 00:01:48,200
but also to conjure
up in your mind.

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,000
So you think of things like this.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,860
When you are trying to
think about problems,

33
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,915
you actually bring the
pictures in your mind.

34
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:56,300
And for those of you
who find pictures,

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,115
not the best way
of seeing things,

36
00:01:58,115 --> 00:02:00,890
then probably the algebra
works better for you.

37
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,020
So you do the algebra, let's see,

38
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,865
everything in C is in a and b.

39
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:11,270
It's exactly the same
as saying two things.

40
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,100
Everything in C is in a
and everything in C is NB.

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,320
Everyone agree, this
is a good rule for,

42
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,350
and so you see what the game is.

43
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,485
The game is to try and describe
these things with rules.

44
00:02:27,485 --> 00:02:29,600
And if we now do what we did for,

45
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,535
not do it for,

46
00:02:31,535 --> 00:02:34,985
and then we have
this function and

47
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:38,840
goes from Booleans to booleans
and gives you a Boolean.

48
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,310
Let's truth table is up in

49
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,275
the top left hand corner there.

50
00:02:42,275 --> 00:02:44,720
This is just a description
of what Haskell

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,815
does when you take the
and of two booleans.

52
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:51,560
If it's false, false,
it gives you false.

53
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,900
If it's false, true,
it gives you false.

54
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,630
If it's false, true the other
way it gives you false.

55
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:59,240
But if it's true, true,
it gives you true.

56
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,490
We extend that to a corresponding
function on predicates,

57
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:08,120
which you know as the function
you see on venn diagrams.

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,690
By saying that a and we

59
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,850
introduce another name for

60
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,015
end because it's a function
of a different type.

61
00:03:17,015 --> 00:03:18,890
And we already have

62
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,400
this e1 is of type bool
arrow is Polaris bu.

63
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,260
We want something
that goes from the

64
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,585
predicate on you to
a predicate on you.

65
00:03:26,585 --> 00:03:30,740
So we have to say a
and in this funny way,

66
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,990
be applied to x

67
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,865
because we want to say
what the predicate is,

68
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:37,880
is I applied to x
and p applied 2x.

69
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,780
When we are talking about the
operations on predicates,

70
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,264
we're always going back to
operations on booleans.

71
00:03:46,264 --> 00:03:47,930
We have a rule, we have a way of

72
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,420
writing it down in Haskell.

73
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,920
We don't need much more.

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,800
What I want you to
do now is to take

75
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,195
a couple of minutes to do the
corresponding rule for all,

76
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:01,730
most of it is that easy?

77
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,940
We can take the o function now we

78
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:08,060
can define a function that
we'll call Funny or here,

79
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,640
and we'll use the old
function that, that's fine.

80
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,560
But how do we draw

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,975
the diagram for all
where with the blue,

82
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:16,820
red, blue circle P,

83
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,724
Start with a Venn diagram.

84
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:20,630
And then you will turn it into

85
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,715
an Euler diagram by
adding the circle.

86
00:04:22,715 --> 00:04:25,040
And what's the rule look like,

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,495
which is even more interesting.

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,710
So we'll do the same again,

89
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:30,200
start with the same Venn
Diagram that we started with.

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,590
But now may the Euler diagram
where you say something

91
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:40,950
about the relationship between
your new thing and a or B.

92
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:44,555
And I have 0B is of
course the union.

93
00:04:44,555 --> 00:04:47,670
And try and write down a rule.

94
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,150
Because what we will see over

95
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,610
the next few lectures

96
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,845
is that once we get
these rolls right,

97
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:58,280
we really understood everything
about these operations.

98
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,730
So your task now is to draw

99
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:05,330
a C such that everything in a or

100
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:09,575
B is contained in C. And use that

101
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:11,300
to write a rule for

102
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,850
all will give the answer
in the next video.
