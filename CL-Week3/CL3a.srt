1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
We finished last time
looking at this.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,750
If we know that in Scotland,

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,660
one is between
10:00 AM, 10:00 PM.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,309
You can legally buy alcohol

5
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:13,020
than if we know
we're in Scotland,

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,940
but we cannot
legally buy alcohol.

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,575
We know it's not like time.

8
00:00:16,575 --> 00:00:19,905
And if we know it is

9
00:00:19,905 --> 00:00:23,820
between those times and
become legally buy alcohol,

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,340
we can infer that
were not in Scotland.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,390
It's true that there might be

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,900
other countries with similar
regulations that make me,

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,535
we're not in those countries

14
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:36,590
if we know something
else about the world,

15
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,760
but from these two
things and that rule,

16
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,310
we can only infer that
were not in Scotland.

17
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,630
We can't, for instance,

18
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,540
say We're not in Saudi Arabia,

19
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,660
even if you can't legally
buy alcohol in Saudi Arabia.

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,460
So it's only the
things that logically

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,530
follow that we're interested in.

22
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,695
What I left you with. With this.

23
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:00,875
Say, we take that pattern,

24
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:04,775
but we apply it to
our first syllogism.

25
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:08,030
The one that everybody
knows is true.

26
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,810
The one that says
everything that satisfies

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,740
a satisfies P and everything
satisfies P satisfies c,

28
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,110
then everything
satisfies a satisfy

29
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,550
C. Now how do we read
the other one is suppose

30
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,205
that everything that's in B

31
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:29,780
satisfy c. Looking appear
on the right hand side.

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,200
Everything resumed.
P satisfies c. Two,

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,505
what is this saying?

34
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:40,100
It's not true that everything
that's in a satisfies S0.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,310
That means that there must
be something in a way that

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,415
does not satisfy C.
Or put the other way,

37
00:01:46,415 --> 00:01:48,905
something in a pair satisfies

38
00:01:48,905 --> 00:01:52,400
not C. So let's go and
look at these rules.

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,364
What can we deduce?

40
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:58,250
We can deduce by

41
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,035
swapping these two from
where they were before.

42
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:07,025
In the thing above, we swap
them and negated them both.

43
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,500
What we're seeing here is

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,895
the different level of argument

45
00:02:10,895 --> 00:02:12,845
from the one we looked at before.

46
00:02:12,845 --> 00:02:16,730
Earlier. Contraposition with
swapping things and changing

47
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,930
whether they've been negated or

48
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,525
not on either side
of the turnstile.

49
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,310
Now we're swapping things

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,665
above and below the
influence line.

51
00:02:24,665 --> 00:02:27,830
This is a good
place to talk about

52
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,420
two different levels of

53
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,360
talking that we do when
we're studying logic.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,435
We say that when we do
contraposition here,

55
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:42,320
we're working in the
logic statements

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,810
in logic and we're manipulating,

57
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,550
then this statement
is equivalent to

58
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,105
that statement when
Tommy contraposition.

59
00:02:50,105 --> 00:02:53,240
When we do what we're doing now,

60
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,520
this is an argument at
the national level.

61
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,720
It's an argument about
rules, about propositions.

62
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
Rules about propositions.

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,710
Propositions,
there's something at

64
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,750
a higher level will
come back to that.

65
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,550
But this is your first
example of really

66
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,455
seeing an object level thing,

67
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:13,310
country contraposition on
either side of the turnstile.

68
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,365
And the mezzo level thing,

69
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:20,765
contraposition on either
side of the influence line.

70
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,180
Now you should hope the video,

71
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,510
take a break, do the
exercise, and then come back.
