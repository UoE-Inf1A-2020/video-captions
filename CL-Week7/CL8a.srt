1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,840
So far we've been looking
at truth and logic.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,910
We've been talking
about predicates.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,595
We've been doing some
algebra predicates.

4
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,190
When we started, I talked
about the book Language,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,690
Truth and Logic, and said that's

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,775
really what we're going to
be doing in this course.

7
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:17,070
We haven't really
talked about language.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,230
We've tried to match

9
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,124
some natural language with
things we do in Haskell,

10
00:00:22,124 --> 00:00:23,310
there is some ideas about

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,590
language and the way
it's meaning could be

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,210
modeled in the way we've

13
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,420
translated phrases
like every ISP,

14
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,715
but we haven't done it
in any formal sense.

15
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:36,120
And certainly the language
we're using every axis,

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,710
why we haven't set
what you can and

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,865
can't say we've just
had some things in,

18
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,465
left the rest unsaid.

19
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:44,360
What we're going to do over
the next three lectures

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,140
also is develop the
idea of language.

21
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,675
But I just want to go back
to algebra for a moment.

22
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,450
Algebra or algebraic expressions.

23
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,745
Very simple example of

24
00:00:55,745 --> 00:00:57,665
one of the ingredients
of language.

25
00:00:57,665 --> 00:00:59,495
So we talk about things,

26
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:02,615
but sometimes we don't
say John or Mary.

27
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:08,090
We say Mary's father or
Shawn's brother or my parents.

28
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,790
What we do is we
have some functions.

29
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,320
We start from John and then

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,850
we have to find John's Brother.

31
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,300
In arithmetic, we start
from numbers and we

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,855
say three plus four
or minus three.

33
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,695
Three plus four is a bit
like saying linguistically,

34
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:27,350
the child of Mary and Mark,

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,210
you take two things and we get

36
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,865
a third thing that's related
to them in some way.

37
00:01:31,865 --> 00:01:33,800
So we try and look
at that in terms of

38
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,934
algebraic expressions that
we take this expression,

39
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,920
X times Y plus Z,

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,025
X times Y plus X times Z.

41
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,080
We can structure the language as

42
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,590
a tree where these are
things that stand for,

43
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,835
things in the world.

44
00:01:49,835 --> 00:01:52,535
These are things that
stand for operations.

45
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:55,970
And really this is a
description, little computation.

46
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,315
It's a description of a
computation that says take x,

47
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:01,370
then add y and z,

48
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,080
and then multiply them by X.

49
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,000
Whereas the other one

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,325
is a description of a
different computation.

51
00:02:07,325 --> 00:02:09,410
That computation
says, take x and y,

52
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,600
multiply them
together, say x and z,

53
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,715
and multiply them together,
then add the results.

54
00:02:13,715 --> 00:02:15,305
So there's a different
computations.

55
00:02:15,305 --> 00:02:17,255
And when we say those Rico,

56
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,370
what we're doing is
comparing the results of

57
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,410
those computations and saying

58
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,850
that they are actually
the same thing.

59
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,140
It's saying something about

60
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,885
the results of
those computations.

61
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,050
It's rather like saying
Marxist resume result,

62
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,875
Marxist one computation, Mary's
ONE another computation.

63
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,120
They happen to be the same.

64
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,699
So when we're doing logic,

65
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,980
we're also doing
little computations,

66
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,010
but they computation's
about truth values.

67
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,410
So this is entirely analogous.

68
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,840
That's the same
equation with and,

69
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,215
and or instead of times and plus,

70
00:02:51,215 --> 00:02:52,760
it's still a computation.

71
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,610
Computation about logic. It says,

72
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,230
if I take logical things a, b,

73
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,290
and c, I take the o of b and say,

74
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,285
I take the hand of that with a.

75
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:04,910
It's the same as taking
the end of a and B,

76
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,485
the end the vacancy,

77
00:03:06,485 --> 00:03:09,365
and during those two together
and we get the same result.

78
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:14,345
These statements about
computations with logical values.

79
00:03:14,345 --> 00:03:16,820
And I say logical values
because we've already

80
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,695
seen that is computation's
could work for Booleans,

81
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:24,050
but they could also
work for predicates.

82
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,910
So there are other
things that we might

83
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,785
see as logical values,

84
00:03:27,785 --> 00:03:30,545
which aren't just the
Booleans themselves,

85
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,810
just the same way as if you

86
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,800
interpret the results of
an algebraic equation.

87
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,085
You can interpret them as
being about the integers,

88
00:03:40,085 --> 00:03:42,754
reals, or complex numbers.

89
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:45,590
There were all sorts of
different things that

90
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,605
have the structure of you
can multiply, you can ahead.

91
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:50,480
So we can interpret as equations

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,145
and the distributive laws work.

93
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:53,420
It's the same with logic.

94
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,030
There were all sorts of
places where we can interpret

95
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,670
those operations and
various laws work.
