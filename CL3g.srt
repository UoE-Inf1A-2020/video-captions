1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310
Now we're going to take

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,770
some control positions and

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:07,034
we're going to make more rules.

4
00:00:07,034 --> 00:00:11,280
So you remember that we made
the first rule barbara.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,349
Then we put Nazi emphases.

6
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:15,930
Leprosy is putting a
different Lateran at

7
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,550
different predicate
Nazi instead of

8
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,100
C. But once we put
the Nazi law and we

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:22,965
could do control
positions because

10
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:30,375
B satisfies not c is the
same as c satisfies not B.

11
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,280
So we could just
swap those around.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,620
Those two things mean
exactly the same,

13
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:37,900
but it gave us a new proposition.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,355
We can do the same thing
now with other rules.

15
00:00:42,355 --> 00:00:44,299
Look at this example.

16
00:00:44,299 --> 00:00:47,945
The ruler at the top is
an exercise for you.

17
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,550
You should be able to derive

18
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,260
it from the mathematicians and

19
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,010
programmers syllogism we
derived in earlier video.

20
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:58,680
Suppose we have this
rule at the top.

21
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:03,410
Then we can do something
like substitute not b for b.

22
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,650
So here we've got NOT B and B.

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,570
Just by substituting not b for b,

24
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,180
we change that to a b to not

25
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:14,330
be just substituting justice we

26
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,210
before we substituted Nazi for C.

27
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:20,810
But when you substitute
not B and not B,

28
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,910
you get not, not p. So
you get a feedback.

29
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,595
And then we can say, Oh, look,

30
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:31,700
this can be contrapposto.
So we take that.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,085
So this is another new rule.

32
00:01:34,085 --> 00:01:36,785
How many new rules can you get?

33
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:41,375
Right? You will be expected
to remember all of these.

34
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:44,150
In fact, when they are
given in this form,

35
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,250
it's really hard even
if you are given

36
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,925
a rule to find out whether
it is one of the one snare,

37
00:01:49,925 --> 00:01:52,550
cuz it's quite hard
to recognize a rule.

38
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:55,100
You do need to remember this one.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,060
This is Barbara, and this
is where it all starts.

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,620
That's the rule that we all

41
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,200
know is valid the moment
we first think of it,

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,550
you didn't even have to think

43
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,350
if one thing is
contained in another,

44
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,490
is contained in another than

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,275
the first one is
contained in the third.

46
00:02:09,275 --> 00:02:12,500
And it's so easy that we
don't even think about it.

47
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:19,115
What you should be
able to do is to say,

48
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:22,355
okay, how does this come
from the one above?

49
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,830
We just put Nazi.

50
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,110
How do we go from
this one to this one?

51
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,970
We direct transposition there.

52
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,580
Ok, where does this
one come from?

53
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,570
Philip at the tops and

54
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,830
the top of that is
the same as that

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,410
if I look at the bottom and
the bottom of this type,

56
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,030
just the contraposition, then we

57
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,415
know that when we do
that contraposition,

58
00:02:49,415 --> 00:02:51,020
we are basically
saying the same things

59
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,595
or if one is valid,
the other one is.

60
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:54,470
So this rule is also valid.

61
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,600
How do we go from here to here?

62
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:59,000
We went here, we did that.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,755
We swapped the first one.

64
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,450
We swap the second one.

65
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,240
And now what are we going to
do coming from here to here?

66
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,095
Swap the first one back.

67
00:03:09,095 --> 00:03:11,705
We have the original, we
have the one substituted,

68
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,540
and then we can either
swap none of them,

69
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,270
swap one of them, swap
the other row, swap both.

70
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,020
That's what we did on Tuesday.

71
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,890
What happens now is we
can play another game.

72
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,525
We can go this way.

73
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:30,155
What I've done here is to say,

74
00:03:30,155 --> 00:03:35,090
what happens if I take a
implies b and leave it alone.

75
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,505
But swap these two.

76
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:40,835
But of course, when we swap them,

77
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:43,249
it's just like the
alcohol in Scotland.

78
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,605
The conclusion is false.

79
00:03:45,605 --> 00:03:48,980
Then we know that one of
the assumptions is false.

80
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,835
So I've taken the conclusion
and said we know it's false.

81
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:55,070
One of the assumptions,

82
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,270
and this is the same, it's

83
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,490
the conclusion you
may say it's false.

84
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,770
But we've taken the other of

85
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,860
the assumptions of this
retains that assumption.

86
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,840
This retains that assumption.

87
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,695
And this one has it
negated down there.

88
00:04:09,695 --> 00:04:14,990
And this one has this
assumption negated down there.

89
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:17,690
That line is just

90
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,995
doing the logic we did for
the alcohol in Scotland.

91
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,740
We get two new rules that

92
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,275
have not seen them
out of one rule,

93
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:29,840
but didn't have the
knots at the meta level.

94
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,180
Can anyone find this from
whatever the adjacent rules?

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,140
I think that one's done by
during the bottom line,

96
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:44,195
just a contra position there.

97
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:47,945
Can we find something
that corresponds to

98
00:04:47,945 --> 00:04:52,265
swapping these two
and negating them?

99
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:55,820
Which we know should be that
if we got a complete set and

100
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:00,810
the answer is the one next to it.
