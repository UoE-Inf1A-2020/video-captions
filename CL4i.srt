1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
Now we're going to see how to

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:05,490
use these rules constructively.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,640
Going to take an
expression and use

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,225
the rules to simplify it to
an equivalent expression.

5
00:00:12,225 --> 00:00:15,495
The expression I've
chosen to simplify it,

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:18,690
just a randomly chosen example

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,085
created using the
connectives and, or and not.

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:26,700
The procedure we use will
work for any example.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,990
I wanted to find a rule
that will leave me above

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,520
the line with something

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,465
simpler than what I
have below the line.

12
00:00:36,465 --> 00:00:40,260
How can I make something
simpler above the line?

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,010
By simpler?

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,920
What I mean is I'll get rid of

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,045
some of these connective
so we call NOT and, OR,

16
00:00:50,045 --> 00:00:51,710
and later on other operations

17
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,750
on Boolean values connectives,

18
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,070
because we're thinking now is

19
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:58,055
connecting this statement
with this statement.

20
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:00,080
This is made up by saying

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,315
we have this thing
within brackets

22
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:07,670
or p. That means we have an
OH on the right hand side.

23
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,640
So we look at this
rule to simplify it.

24
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,155
How has that happened?

25
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,955
We took the rule here.

26
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:21,365
The a was matched against
this thing in parentheses.

27
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:23,570
The B was matched against that

28
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,169
P. Those are the things
that are joined by all.

29
00:01:27,169 --> 00:01:30,905
And we replace that
or by a comma.

30
00:01:30,905 --> 00:01:32,600
And then of course we
could take off some of

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,445
the brackets because they
just get in the way.

32
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:35,645
We don't need them anymore.

33
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:37,130
So what's going to happen next?

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,155
Which rule are we going to use?

35
00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:42,770
The only thing we can do is
to take the main connective.

36
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:44,420
We can't get inside these things.

37
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,350
We can't reach those knots
yet because they're inside.

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,415
An expression that's
been made with

39
00:01:52,415 --> 00:01:54,875
end and is the main thing here,

40
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:57,140
and it's on the right.
We'll use the rule.

41
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:03,440
And on the right, we should
expect to get that rule.

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,910
And what will we get on top?

43
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,915
Try thinking what it'll
pay and see if you agree.

44
00:02:08,915 --> 00:02:16,175
There. We have this
piece and this piece,

45
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:18,980
and then delta is
just p. So we're

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,920
here and we've got
the end on the right,

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,244
and the delta is
just a singleton.

48
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:27,380
It's got p. So I take the
left-hand thing of this,

49
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,585
which is not p or q,

50
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,300
and the right hand thing
of this which is not p,

51
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,540
and I split them and I put
this one here with delta,

52
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,155
and this one here
with delta was next.

53
00:02:39,155 --> 00:02:41,990
We can do that one because
it's not a simple one.

54
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,690
Will do the rule not are.

55
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:49,430
If I do that, then I
get the p on the left.

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,305
And then immediately
I can notice that,

57
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,125
wow, there is the same
thing, left and right.

58
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,380
What does this tell me
if I stop at this stage,

59
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:03,485
it tells me that this is
satisfied in some universe.

60
00:03:03,485 --> 00:03:07,040
If and only if this is
satisfied in the same universe.

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,290
If and only if this and this
are satisfied in a universe.

62
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,750
And by the way, this
is satisfied and

63
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,130
the universe if and only if this

64
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,585
is, and they certainly is.

65
00:03:17,585 --> 00:03:19,640
So this pits, we
don't need anymore.

66
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,310
And what we've now shown
is that this thing

67
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,805
satisfied is equivalent
to that being satisfied.

68
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:29,255
We can keep going next row.
What's it going to be?

69
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,820
What's the main
connective is not o.

70
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,635
The o is the o.

71
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:36,755
We do the 4x and that just
replaces the O with a comma.

72
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,585
And now what we do,

73
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,340
we're gonna get rid of
all the connectives

74
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,480
and we've only got one left.

75
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
So we're going to use
not on the right,

76
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,065
we move the p across
with the not,

77
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,315
then we have an immediate rule.

78
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:49,940
Now what we've found is these are

79
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,360
both valid in any universe.

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,175
So these are valid.

81
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:57,230
This is valid, this is valid.

82
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:59,165
This is valid in every universe.

83
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:02,180
We've started with
some expression

84
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,220
and we've broken
it down like that.
