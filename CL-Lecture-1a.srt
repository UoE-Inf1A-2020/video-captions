00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:04,200
Hello, I'm Michael
Fourman and this is

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,760
the first video in

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,925
the computation and logic
stream of Inf1A at,

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:10,200
The University of Edinburgh.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,419
And we're going to start
right at the beginning.

6
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,360
Looking at binary data.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,680
Informatics is the study
of systems that store,

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,635
process and communicate
information.

9
00:00:22,635 --> 00:00:25,575
We're going to look at
that in some detail,

10
00:00:25,575 --> 00:00:28,110
but we're going to
keep it simple.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:33,730
Even simple systems can have
quite complex behaviors.

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:38,780
We're going to begin by
asking, what is information.

13
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,980
We're going to find the
simplest answer we can imagine.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,750
And then study that.

15
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,625
We go to the dictionary.

16
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,120
We find that information
is knowledge

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,635
communicated concerning
some particular fact,

18
00:00:54,635 --> 00:00:57,020
subject or event.

19
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,750
That of which one
is apprised or

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,065
told intelligence or news.

21
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:08,330
So knowledge communicated
is information.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,460
And information is about

23
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,150
some particular fact,
subject or event.

24
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,585
It's something we
can be told or learn.

25
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:21,365
So we can get it from
sensors from other people.

26
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:26,359
We see in 1387 already the
mention of information.

27
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:28,850
So this is not a new concept.

28
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,920
It's a very old concept,

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,650
but we're looking at it
in a very new context,

30
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,150
in a historical sense.

31
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:38,120
So that's already
Knowledge communicated.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:44,450
In 1793. There's talk of a
very considerable information.

33
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,580
So this introduces the
idea that we can have

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,695
more or less information.

35
00:01:48,695 --> 00:01:50,090
And as I said,
we're going to look

36
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,410
at the simplest example.

37
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,790
It turns out there are

38
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,340
atoms of information,
there are indivisible

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,110
bits of information that are

40
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,300
the smallest possible amount of

41
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,555
information you can get
and we'll come to them.

42
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,865
And that's what we'll
study to start with.

43
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:08,180
Then we have in 1852 to use a.

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,250
simile, the brain may be

45
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:14,090
likened to Great Central
Telegraph Office,

46
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,500
to which the wires,

47
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,195
nerves convey the information
from all parts of the body.

48
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:24,650
So here we have the idea that
information in nerves and

49
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,360
information traveling along
wires are both similar.

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,840
And of course nowadays
we have information

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,280
travelling on nerves just
as they did in 1852.

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,340
But the information
traveling along wires is a

53
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,450
lot more sophisticated
than it was in 1852.

54
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,110
In 1927, we have the
grapevine system,

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,210
whereby information travels very

56
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,140
rapidly through the length and
breadth of the underworld.

57
00:02:55,270 --> 00:03:00,230
Nowadays, we have the
internet through which

58
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,750
information travels
very rapidly through

59
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,390
the length and breadth
of the underworld.

60
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,785
We not only have the,

61
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,810
the web, we have the dark web.

62
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,540
That's not a new thing,
that's an old thing.

63
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,705
That information can be misused,

64
00:03:14,705 --> 00:03:17,550
can be for good or for evil.

65
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,895
I went to Google and searched
for examples of information.

66
00:03:30,895 --> 00:03:33,550
And this is what I found
or at least one of the many,

67
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,309
many, many things
that Google returned.

68
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:39,160
Examples of
information we collect

69
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,135
and analyze times, places,

70
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:49,450
events, your activities,
details of your hardware,

71
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,355
details of your connection.

72
00:03:51,355 --> 00:03:53,455
When they take your data,

73
00:03:53,455 --> 00:03:56,500
they take all these
sorts of information,

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:05,210
pictures, numbers,
sounds, and so on.

75
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,610
And convert them into

76
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,615
computer data in the
form of zeros and ones.

77
00:04:11,615 --> 00:04:13,310
And we're going to look in

78
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,250
slightly more detail
at that process of

79
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:22,415
taking information and converting
it into zeros and ones.

80
00:04:22,415 --> 00:04:25,580
So information for us is going to

81
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,940
be about answers to questions,

82
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,610
who, what, where, when,

83
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,600
why, and how,
questions and answers.

84
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,295
And we're going to
see how answers,

85
00:04:38,295 --> 00:04:43,204
the questions can be broken
down into zeros and ones.

86
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:47,390
As I said, our motto
is to keep it simple.

87
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,360
The keep it simple. Principle states

88
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,239
that most systems work best.

89
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:54,665
If they are kept simple,

90
00:04:54,665 --> 00:04:56,705
rather than made complicated.

91
00:04:56,705 --> 00:04:59,600
And that's normally applied

92
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,560
as a principle of
practical engineering.

93
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,290
But it's also a
very good principle

94
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,215
of theoretical investigation.

95
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:10,880
We're going to look for

96
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,350
simple examples and
examine them in detail.

97
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,645
We're going to look
at simple questions.

98
00:05:17,645 --> 00:05:21,080
Simple questions are questions
that have simple answers.

99
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,495
So the first simplification
will look at

100
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:27,034
is that every question
gets an answer.

101
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:31,220
So there is at least one
we'll eliminate questions

102
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,080
with no answers or questions that

103
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,405
don't give you an answer,

104
00:05:35,405 --> 00:05:39,215
We assume that the answer
comes within a finite time,

105
00:05:39,215 --> 00:05:43,160
then we want questions
that are not fuzzy.

106
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,510
We don't want questions where

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,000
the answer is vague or imprecise.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,315
We want a question that
gives a precise answer.

109
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:51,950
And we're going to actually make

110
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,585
it even simpler than that.

111
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,150
We're going to look at
questions that only have

112
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,165
a finite number of
possible answers.

113
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,415
And to keep simplifying,

114
00:06:01,415 --> 00:06:04,925
we've eliminated
questions with 0 answers,

115
00:06:04,925 --> 00:06:07,505
questions with one answer,

116
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,650
are a bit uninteresting.

117
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,940
They're not totally useless,

118
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,840
but they are not particularly
interesting. Questions with

119
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,730
two answers are the first
interesting case of a question.

120
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:22,130
So the simplest
question we can think

121
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:26,210
of is a question
that has two answers.

122
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:29,370
That leads us to binary data.

123
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,990
We can represent the two answers

124
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,240
as zeros and ones, yeses and nos,

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,055
all sorts of different ways
of naming the alternatives.

126
00:06:39,055 --> 00:06:40,555
But the key thing is,

127
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,970
we will have questions
that always give

128
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,660
an answer and there are
only two possible answers,

129
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,880
yes or no, we'll use

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,584
various names and various
notations for the answers.

131
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:55,855
We can think of a
tick and across,

132
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:57,070
such as I might put on

133
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,770
an exam at the end
of the semester.

134
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,650
We have up and down.

135
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,005
We have true and false,

136
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,925
which will normally focus on.

137
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:09,110
And then we have some
symbols that we will use.

138
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,200
So we use T for true.

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,510
And this symbol, which
is an upside down T

140
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,635
for false falsity is
truth stood on its head.

141
00:07:20,635 --> 00:07:22,780
And we give names
to these symbols.

142
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,465
This is top and bottom.

143
00:07:25,465 --> 00:07:29,020
And that ordering,
that top is above

144
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,460
bottom will be very

145
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,205
useful in our
investigations later on.

146
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:34,750
When we're thinking like

147
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,420
engineers we'll
often use zeros and

148
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,805
ones 0 for false
and one for true.

149
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:46,780
But it doesn't really matter
what the names of these are.

150
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,880
It does matter that
we know which one

151
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,340
is true and which one is false.

152
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,660
And we swap them over,

153
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,420
we change the world entirely.

154
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,020
So that's going to take us to

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:00,320
an investigation in
the next video of how

156
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,470
we can talk about general
things using yes-no questions.

157
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,185
In this video, we
introduce the idea of

158
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:11,480
information as the
kind of thing that

159
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,375
is given by the
answer to a question.

160
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:17,180
Then we looked at
simple questions

161
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,040
which always give an answer,

162
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,020
but only have finitely
many possible answers.

163
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,604
And then we looked at
questions with binary answers

164
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:32,190
and identified those as the
simplest possible questions.
