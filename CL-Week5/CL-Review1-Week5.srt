1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:04,120
Good morning. Going to go through

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,370
the basics of syllogisms

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,350
starting right from
the very beginning.

4
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:13,315
In the beginning, we have
a universe full of things.

5
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:14,980
And we want to say something about

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,690
the things in the universe.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,300
So for instance, we may say there

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,240
are things that have
the property a.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,950
So I've drawn the set of

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,620
things such that they
have the property a.

11
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:29,770
A property is represented as

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:32,980
a function from
things to booleans.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,439
And in here we have
the set of things,

14
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,190
x, such that a of x is true.

15
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,470
And outside, we have the set of

16
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:44,930
things such that a of x is false.

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:47,435
We can then have
another property,

18
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:50,930
b, and everything
that is in a is in b.

19
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,030
So whenever a of x is true,

20
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,785
b of x is also true.

21
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:56,960
In here, a of x is false,

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,445
but b of x is true.

23
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:00,605
And out here, both
of them are false.

24
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:04,415
We write this relationship
as every a is b.

25
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,440
We can have another
property which is to

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,965
say that every a is NOT b.

27
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:12,875
Let's draw a picture of
that. In this example,

28
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:16,850
here's a. And if I want to
say that every a is NOT b,

29
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,290
then I put b here.

30
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:23,195
Every a is not b. For any x
for which a of x is true,

31
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:24,800
b of x is false.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,640
It's also true that for any
x for which b of x is true,

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,020
a of x is false.

34
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:34,595
So that's the same as
saying every b is not a.

35
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,670
Now on the diagrams those
two look very different.

36
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,290
But that's just because
of the way we've

37
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,690
chosen to draw the diagram.

38
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,970
If I look at this apple. On here,

39
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,215
I've drawn a on one side
and b on the other side.

40
00:01:48,215 --> 00:01:52,580
So that is like this
diagram put on an apple.

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,625
What if I try and draw
this diagram on the apple?

42
00:01:55,625 --> 00:01:57,304
Is it a different diagram?

43
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:00,590
And now I'm going to draw a here.

44
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,735
And then I have to
draw b around it,

45
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:05,330
but suppose I draw
b round there,

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,880
I can make it bigger
and bigger until in

47
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,090
the end I can draw b round here.

48
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,565
So now we have there, b.

49
00:02:13,565 --> 00:02:16,310
Of course, the things
in b are here.

50
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,280
Every a is in b and
the things in b are there.

51
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,365
These are the things
that are not b.

52
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:23,900
But if I now compare
both my apples,

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,380
then I've just got the circles.

54
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,580
And the only difference is
in the way I labeled b.

55
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,160
The only difference is
whether I consider on

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,680
this apple for b to be true in

57
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,260
this direction and
on this apple for

58
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,065
b to be true in that direction.

59
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:44,640
These two diagrams,

60
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,040
if we draw them on an
apple, become equivalent.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,515
It's useful to have
a notation where

62
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:54,185
we don't have to draw
things on apples.

63
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,970
If we use a Venn diagram,

64
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,740
we can see the relationship

65
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,945
between these things
more clearly.

66
00:02:59,945 --> 00:03:05,960
Here. We say I have a, I have B.

67
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,765
And whereas in an Euler diagram,

68
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:11,060
there's an assumption that every

69
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,850
region we see on the diagram -
here we see three regions:

70
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,485
this one, this one, and this one -

71
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,810
every region has
something in it. On

72
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,240
a Venn Diagram. We don't.

73
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,645
So here we can draw
this diagram and say,

74
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:27,440
what's special is that
of these four regions,

75
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,510
one of them isn't

76
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,195
in the Euler diagram
because it's empty.

77
00:03:32,195 --> 00:03:35,660
And in this case, it's
this one that's empty.

78
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,930
In this case, which
region is empty?

79
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,730
We still have only
three regions here:

80
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,070
we have the thing where
they're both false,

81
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,420
where one of them is true,

82
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,755
where the other is true.

83
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:48,470
But we're missing any region
where they're both true.

84
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,090
So we're missing this piece.

85
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,570
The Venn diagram on an
apple would simply say,

86
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:00,875
let's draw something
like this for a.

87
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,560
And let say a is true on

88
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,815
this side and not a on this side.

89
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:09,080
This could be the
Greenwich Meridian.

90
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,170
And then we'll use the
equator for b, let's say

91
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,390
b is true up here,

92
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,060
and b is false down here.

93
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,810
So then we have all four
places represented.

94
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:23,660
And all that's happening
is that we're saying one of

95
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,380
these places is empty for
each of these diagrams.

96
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,925
And here you can
see the symmetry.

97
00:04:28,925 --> 00:04:32,300
So really, although
for Aristotle,

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,030
these were very
different propositions.

99
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,300
For us, we can treat
them exactly similarly.
