1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Searching for a consistent
set of literals such

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,510
that this set of literals
gamma makes this true,

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:09,000
makes this true, makes this
true, makes this true.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,490
In other words, makes one
of these, one of these,

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,080
one of these, and one of these,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,295
because they're on the right.

7
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:15,825
So what could you say?

8
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:17,700
There are 32 possibilities

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,930
which I don't want to go through.

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,270
But what if I say, let's
choose one literal.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,665
Let's make a true.

12
00:00:22,665 --> 00:00:24,120
What happens to these?

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,560
If I make a true,
what can we say?

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,925
The way we approach
that is to say,

15
00:00:28,925 --> 00:00:31,190
let's replace gamma
that we had before,

16
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:33,170
which was something I
know nothing about with

17
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,630
a followed by some other things.

18
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,150
And it will list, you'd
say x followed by xs,

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,290
where we're looking at the exit,

20
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,600
the beginning, we're looking
at the a at the beginning.

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,115
We said there's a
at the beginning.

22
00:00:43,115 --> 00:00:45,155
If I know there's an
a at the beginning,

23
00:00:45,155 --> 00:00:46,610
what can I put up here

24
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,500
that is simpler than
what's down here?

25
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:51,770
And hopefully your memories
might go back to last Friday.

26
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,065
I already showed you this once.

27
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:55,760
We're going to have to
show you it three times.

28
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,010
So you remember, I
suppose if I do this,

29
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:59,090
what can I do with this?

30
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,495
Not a, what rule can I
apply to this node a?

31
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:04,880
I can not on the right,

32
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,425
which moves it over to the left.

33
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:08,705
If I move it to the
left and I've got,

34
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:10,190
it looks as though I've got 2A

35
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:11,675
is on the left. This is a set.

36
00:01:11,675 --> 00:01:14,825
So actually when I move it to
the left, I just get that.

37
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:17,075
And I could just as
well cross it out.

38
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:19,175
Similarly here I can
cross this one out.

39
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:20,315
What about this rule?

40
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:21,740
What do I put above the line?

41
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,390
Nothing, right?

42
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,935
It's the immediate row.

43
00:01:24,935 --> 00:01:26,360
Nothing above the line.

44
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,030
So this will be much
simpler above the line.

45
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,650
I've moved this eye across it got

46
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:33,680
absorbed that because two
ways it's the same as 1A.

47
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,970
I move this across.

48
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,190
It got absorbed
because two A's is the

49
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,590
same as 1A and these
two disappear.

50
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,680
All I need to do now is
to solve this problem.

51
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,485
Because solving this
problem is equivalent.

52
00:01:45,485 --> 00:01:48,710
If I'm making a true to
solving the original problem,

53
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,045
did I make this step?

54
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:51,590
What's the argument to say?

55
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,145
Actually, all I need to
do is to find a gamma

56
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:59,135
that satisfies not PC and a
gamma that satisfies DRF.

57
00:01:59,135 --> 00:02:01,670
I don't need to worry
about anymore. Why not?

58
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,780
Pi construction?

59
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,580
I've got rid of all the A's here,

60
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,215
so there aren't
always on the right.

61
00:02:06,215 --> 00:02:08,000
So the value of a,
it doesn't make

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,310
any difference to whether
something's satisfies this.

63
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,640
So now I've reduced the
problem of finding a,

64
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,710
deciding that a should be

65
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,830
true and finding a gamma
that together with a

66
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,335
will make all of these
true to the problem of

67
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:23,000
finding a gamma that makes

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,725
these true and makes these true.

69
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:26,525
And then I put the a
back on the beginning.

70
00:02:26,525 --> 00:02:27,845
We're trying to find,

71
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,810
we decide it will make a true.

72
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,190
We're trying to find a gamma that

73
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,510
together with they will work.

74
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,180
We've reduced it to just
finding a gamma here.

75
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,700
By now, the problem
is simple enough.

76
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,530
You should be able to
solve it in your heads.

77
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,415
How can I find a gamma that
satisfies both this and this?

78
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,530
I can see four ways of doing it.

79
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,035
How many ways can I find
them making this true?

80
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:52,445
Either I make be false or I
may see true in either case,

81
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:54,590
if I make not p true here,

82
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,360
then not B will be true that

83
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,400
if I make Nazi true here, sorry,

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,590
they make ZI true here and
see it'll be true that,

85
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,540
so in either case I can
finish it off just by

86
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,375
making either be false or true.

87
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:08,975
Similarly here I finish it off
by making de true or true.

88
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:10,970
And because I've got
two choices here,

89
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,255
two choices that there's four
ways of making this true.

90
00:03:14,255 --> 00:03:16,535
So I could list all
four of those paths,

91
00:03:16,535 --> 00:03:20,615
not BD, not PF, CD, CF.

92
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,100
And for each of the
micro put an a on

93
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,990
the beginning and we
would have discovered

94
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,630
the IRR precisely for

95
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:29,900
wages of making this
possible staff true.

96
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,520
When we choose to make a true,

97
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,620
we're also interested
in what might

98
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,130
happen if we made a false
naught a and gamma,

99
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:38,735
naught a and gamma,

100
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,850
we've got the
immediate rho naught

101
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,190
a and gamma naught a and gamma,

102
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,525
we can absorb the eye.

103
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:47,060
So this is similar
to what I did last

104
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,300
time when I had the
a is underneath,

105
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,659
except that this time
these two things survive.

106
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:57,470
This time, how many ways we
have of making this true?

107
00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:00,830
How many ways we have making
these two true as it three,

108
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,960
I think it's 21 is we make p

109
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,690
true once we might be
true, table's true.

110
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,245
And the other one is we
make a truancy false.

111
00:04:09,245 --> 00:04:10,670
We don't need to
say anything about

112
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,520
P naught being true.
So I think it's 23.
