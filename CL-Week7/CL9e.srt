1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
And what we've done is to
say that if a happens,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:04,860
then we take all of these things

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:06,990
and we reduce them to
the simpler thing.

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,280
If not a happens,

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,170
then we take all of
these things and we

6
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,165
reduce them to these two things.

7
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:15,585
That tells us that if
we take a less clauses,

8
00:00:15,585 --> 00:00:18,720
then the models of these clauses,

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,200
this is just translating,

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,120
hopefully what we have
here, not a, not B,

11
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,420
C and a and VPC not a,

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,630
D, F and a PD PDF.

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,650
So negative a positivity
positive f, that's our form.

14
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:36,140
And the work we've
just done tells us

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,690
that if I say make a true

16
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:44,074
positive a together with the
models of these two clauses.

17
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:46,400
So that says the
models of these two,

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,960
those are the four models that

19
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,880
we talked about
three minutes ago.

20
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,810
Or put a false together with
a model that comes from.

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,370
And we already worked
out that there were

22
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,815
two models that we did
that in our heads.

23
00:00:57,815 --> 00:01:01,700
But in software, we
do that recursively.

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,310
Say, if I have
something that takes

25
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:08,750
the models of a list of clauses
using some kind of atoms,

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:11,210
then the models
that we get can be

27
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,615
divided into the ones
that make a true,

28
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:18,230
and then models for the simpler
thing and the ones that

29
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,890
make a false and then models
for this simpler thing.

30
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,874
So in order to turn
that into an algorithm,

31
00:01:24,874 --> 00:01:26,600
we need to write something,

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,570
a little program that
says what happens when I

33
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,975
take a set of clauses
here and make a false.

34
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:34,460
And then I want to
know what the things

35
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:35,675
I get up here are.

36
00:01:35,675 --> 00:01:37,295
What set of clauses I get that,

37
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:40,820
and what happens if I make a
true? What happens up there?

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,300
In general, if I take a
literal and a set of clauses,

39
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,100
what happens, flat
set of clauses,

40
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,540
if I make this literal true,

41
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,640
it's either a positive
or a negative,

42
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,560
a, or positively or negatively.

43
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,330
I mean, all the literals count

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,250
will start on the implementation.

45
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,005
What I want you to
have in your heads

46
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,495
is I can take any set of clauses,

47
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,980
I can take any literal,

48
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,990
and I can make that
set of clauses

49
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,750
simpler by making
that literal true,

50
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,220
like make it simpler another

51
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,710
way by making that
literal false, if I,

52
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,900
first of all, we'll
make that literal true,

53
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,495
make it simpler and
solve that problem.

54
00:02:14,495 --> 00:02:17,345
Then I find the valuations
that make those true.

55
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,125
And then I also take a
simplification, making it false,

56
00:02:21,125 --> 00:02:22,820
take the solutions for that and

57
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,055
put a negative on the
beginning of those.

58
00:02:25,055 --> 00:02:26,480
So we've divide and conquer.

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,390
We've made it simpler in one
way, simpler another way,

60
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,460
we've solved the two
simpler problems

61
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,035
and put the thing back together.

62
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:36,770
That's a hugely important
way of solving problems

63
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,630
in computing so many times you

64
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,910
will do a divide and
conquer algorithm.

65
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,710
And this is just a
good example of it.

66
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,284
You take a problem,

67
00:02:44,284 --> 00:02:48,320
you find a way of making it
into two simpler problems.

68
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,065
Such that if you solve
the two simpler problems,

69
00:02:51,065 --> 00:02:53,270
you have a way of putting
those solutions back

70
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,520
together to solve
the bigger problem?

71
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,310
Ask yourself again,
can you find a model

72
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,400
with a true say you go up the
top there and you say Yes,

73
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,970
I can find 1234 models on the top

74
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,665
that you should be able to find

75
00:03:06,665 --> 00:03:08,840
four models that make this true.

76
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,155
Can you find a model that
make not a true here?

77
00:03:12,155 --> 00:03:15,275
We can find two models
that make not a true.

78
00:03:15,275 --> 00:03:17,930
So can you find all
models for the original?

79
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,800
Yes. You take these
four models and put

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,510
a on the beginning
because these four models

81
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,805
only tell you about
things other than a,

82
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:26,990
you take these two models

83
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,655
and put north I on the beginning.

84
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:32,330
So altogether we will get
six models for this thing.

85
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,860
What I'm asking you
here is to find them.

86
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,940
So list out six.
