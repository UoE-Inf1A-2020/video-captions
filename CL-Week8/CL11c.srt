1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,170
So the upshot of this is
we have these stages,

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,670
we eliminate that and
eliminate these to get here.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,940
And push in the
negation to get here,

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,610
then to this, to get there.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:17,250
So this is r if and only if

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,255
a and g. You've already
seen this slide,

7
00:00:20,255 --> 00:00:21,530
it's easier to get

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,560
the same result using a
Karnaugh map. What's more?

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,720
The Karnaugh map is a more
general way of doing it,

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,935
but you should be
able to do both.

11
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,560
So this is doing the
same for Karnaugh map.

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,030
And how have we done this?

13
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:35,810
So if we're trying to get
an expression like that,

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,895
R if and only if something.

15
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:40,445
And let's say there's some
things in two variables.

16
00:00:40,445 --> 00:00:42,380
I am using a and b.

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,405
So if I say a and B,

18
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,100
then that says b is true.

19
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,500
So I mean these two
rows and a is true,

20
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,790
so I mean those two columns.

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,560
So this is a and B.

22
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,500
Our divides the world
into two halves.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,455
The hub where R is
false and a half where

24
00:00:57,455 --> 00:01:00,560
R is true in half
where R is true,

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,660
then R if and only if a

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:05,060
and b if and only
if a and B is true.

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,905
So in the bottom
half of the world,

28
00:01:06,905 --> 00:01:08,150
we just take that piece.

29
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,165
And in the top half of the
world where R is false,

30
00:01:11,165 --> 00:01:15,605
then r is the same as a and G
if and only if we have a 0.

31
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:17,240
So these ones come there.

32
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,500
What's above the line is

33
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,360
the complement of
what's below the line.

34
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,955
So it's actually
very easy to fill in

35
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:26,045
these Karnaugh maps for this
particular kind of problem.

36
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:28,490
And luckily, this particular kind

37
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,125
of problem is
particularly useful.

38
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,250
And we'll see why in a moment.
