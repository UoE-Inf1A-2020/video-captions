1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,335
That's a bit boring because
we could already draw that.

2
00:00:04,335 --> 00:00:06,840
We're going to look
at problems which are

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,270
formed from such
binary constraints.

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,555
So here's an example.

5
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:20,730
Universities have very
weird regulation.

6
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,470
Sometimes you may not take

7
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:24,555
both archaeology
and cameras three,

8
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,775
not a or not see.

9
00:00:26,775 --> 00:00:28,770
You can't take both of them.

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,470
That's how we say
you can't get both.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,080
You say not one or the other.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,910
And that came up in the exercise

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,754
that we're doing
for your tutorial.

14
00:00:37,754 --> 00:00:39,060
If you take biology,

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,980
you must K chemistries

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,580
that biology Implies
chemistry or not.

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,210
B or c, you must take
biology or archaeology.

18
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,070
And B or a. If you

19
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:51,395
take chemistry, your
mistake, divinity.

20
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:54,320
And you may not take both
divinity and biology.

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,615
So again, it's not the
or not be question.

22
00:00:56,615 --> 00:00:59,360
What combinations of
course is can you take?

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,970
So we have a, B,

24
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,060
C, D, four different courses.

25
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,990
So there are 16 possible
combinations of cost is

26
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,430
that we could take and which of

27
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,950
those combinations
satisfy these rules?

28
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,390
It's not immediately obvious,

29
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,710
but what we're going to do is

30
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,570
say a method that
makes it obvious,

31
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,875
we can translate this,

32
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:23,585
not BOC Back to the b implies
c that it originally had.

33
00:01:23,585 --> 00:01:27,290
We can translate this
to a implies Nazi,

34
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,160
we can translate this
to not B implies a,

35
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,440
and this one to C implies D,

36
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,005
And this one to
the implies not B.

37
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:39,560
So we can translate each
of those conditions into

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,240
an implication by saying that

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,470
this o corresponds
to r implies not a.

40
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,380
They saw corresponds
to not a implies

41
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,725
that this corresponds
to not r implies a,

42
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:53,960
and this corresponds
to north of this,

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,745
which is our implies B.

44
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:57,380
You can do that two ways,

45
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,630
as well as saying the Nada
or a means r implies not a.

46
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,075
It also means the
contrapositive that

47
00:02:05,075 --> 00:02:09,080
a implies not r. And
similarly with this one,

48
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,870
vitals meaning not
a implies not g,

49
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,300
It also means g implies a.

50
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,885
Each time we have a
clause with two literals,

51
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:19,220
then it corresponds to

52
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,190
two equivalent implications
that both equivalent.

53
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,845
So all three things
here were equivalent.

54
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:26,960
Sometimes with the method
that we're going to look at,

55
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,330
you need to use only
one of these forms and

56
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,375
sometimes you'll have to
actually both of those.

57
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,190
That's just showing
how that comes.

58
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,055
Because of course this
disjunction is symmetric.

59
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:39,890
Not r or not a is the
same as not a or not are.

60
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:42,650
If I have clauses
with two literals,

61
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,615
they correspond to implications.

62
00:02:44,615 --> 00:02:47,060
In fact, each one because
of contraposition,

63
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,890
corresponds to two implications.

64
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,989
So we can think of them
in terms of implication.

65
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:53,270
But that means that
we can try drawing

66
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,010
diagram rather like that one

67
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,870
just for a implies b that I had.

68
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:00,365
And think about how truth
values might work for them.

69
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,405
Remember, a implies b is true.

70
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:03,680
If a is less than or equal to

71
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,300
b and we're giving things value,

72
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,354
we're giving them Boolean values,

73
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,415
making something's true
and something's false.

74
00:03:10,415 --> 00:03:13,040
And if there is an arrow
going from a to b,

75
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,335
then if we make a true,

76
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,775
we have to make be true.

77
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:18,980
That means that the head
of the arrow either

78
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,230
must be on the same side as a.

79
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,630
So we've got a arrow
b, b's at the head.

80
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,770
If a is false,

81
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,150
the head can be anywhere it can

82
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,935
be true, or it can be below.

83
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,270
The value of a has to be

84
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,755
less than or equal
to the value of B.

85
00:03:30,755 --> 00:03:31,955
If I separate them,

86
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:33,650
ones above, that's fine.

87
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,075
If I put them both above,

88
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:37,160
that's fine because there's
two less than or equal.

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,155
But if I try and go
the other way round,

90
00:03:39,155 --> 00:03:42,110
I'm not giving them values
that are less than or equal.

91
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,475
So I can cut here,

92
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:45,740
and that makes these two true.

93
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,240
I can cut here, and that makes

94
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,565
this one true. And
that one's false.

95
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:52,715
And cut here, and that
makes both of them false.

96
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,360
That's the rule for
a single arrow.

97
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,745
And if you've got a rule
for a single arrow,

98
00:03:58,745 --> 00:04:00,170
then you really got this

99
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,135
because all you have
to do then is to

100
00:04:02,135 --> 00:04:03,980
make sure that for however

101
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,990
many arrows you've
got on your diagram,

102
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,525
for each of them, you follow
the rule for a single arrow.

103
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,190
The rule is if an arrow

104
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,650
crosses the line
between true and false,

105
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,090
then it must point upwards where

106
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,905
it crosses, not downwards.

107
00:04:15,905 --> 00:04:18,690
Evaluation make
some literals true.

108
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,585
Of course the negation is false.

109
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:22,130
So we can always
draw a picture of

110
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,010
evaluation by saying these
are the ones that are true.

111
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,285
And we'll put them
above the line,

112
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,820
and this one's false and we'll
put them below the line.

113
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,630
Now suppose I have that
valuation and I say,

114
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,325
does that valuation make
a arrow is be true?

115
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:40,370
Does that valuation
make arrows be true?

116
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,090
The answer is, you just
draw the arrow from a to

117
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,755
b and you cheque that where it

118
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:48,110
crosses the line,
it goes upwards.

119
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,980
Does this valuation
make D arrows a true?

120
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,295
No, because if I draw the
line from here to here,

121
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,620
then it's a bad line,
it goes the wrong way.

122
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,970
If we have the evaluation
here and you asked question,

123
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,730
is this arrow satisfied or not,

124
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,845
then you can easily
Aren't. You draw them.

125
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:07,940
And if you find an error, you

126
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,230
have to cross out like that,

127
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,539
then you haven't satisfied
all the conditions.

128
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:14,405
Are we going to do is
to use that backwards.

129
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:15,800
We're going to say,

130
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,140
suppose I have the arrows,

131
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,525
but I don't yet
have the valuation.

132
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:23,990
Can I use the diagram
with the arrows to draw

133
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:28,175
a line that makes evaluation
that satisfies the rules.

134
00:05:28,175 --> 00:05:31,355
So this was, we have
evaluation, we draw a line.

135
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:34,535
What we're going to do
next is we have a diagram.

136
00:05:34,535 --> 00:05:36,814
We draw a line and that
gives us evaluation.

137
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,480
The line we draw has to be such.

138
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,280
It doesn't break
any of these rules.
