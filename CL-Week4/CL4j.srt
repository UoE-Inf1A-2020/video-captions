1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,815
What I want you to do now

2
00:00:01,815 --> 00:00:04,395
is to try and keep
up with the machine.

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:07,725
It'll just start doing
this itself slowly.

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:10,140
I want you to look
at what's here and

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,005
think what's the next
stage going to be?

6
00:00:13,005 --> 00:00:16,125
For instance, here, this
is the main connective,

7
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:18,240
is to the right of the turnstile.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,460
So we'll use or on the right.

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,720
That's this one.

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,995
We'll replace it with a comma,

11
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:25,980
or what I want you to do is
to just try and keep up.

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,365
We've identified the or

13
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:30,645
the comma goes in and we
get that one on the right.

14
00:00:30,645 --> 00:00:32,384
Now what's the main connective?

15
00:00:32,384 --> 00:00:34,410
It's not on the outside there.

16
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,450
When there's a choice
between doing something

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,940
that moves one thing or
something, branches.

18
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,470
Do the one thing first,
because you'll get rid of it.

19
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:43,715
You won't have two copies of it.

20
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:45,350
So what's the next connective?

21
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,060
We could either do an end on

22
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,220
the left or on or on the right.

23
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,780
And since those are both easy,

24
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,040
because what do we do with ans on

25
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,650
the left replaced
them with commerce.

26
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,555
And what do we do with
Always On the right

27
00:00:56,555 --> 00:00:58,595
replaced them with commerce.

28
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:03,575
So this time we will just
replace those with commerce.

29
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,440
And now let's start on the left,

30
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,970
I think is where I've
decided to do it.

31
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,420
Yes. What happens
within or on the left?

32
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,710
This all this proves

33
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:18,605
that means that we have to
have, this proves that.

34
00:01:18,605 --> 00:01:21,560
And this proves that both of
them have to go on the left,

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,060
so we have to duplicate it.

36
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,435
We get the not a
and then the rest,

37
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:29,615
and we get the b.
And then the rest.

38
00:01:29,615 --> 00:01:32,030
Now doesn't have to be

39
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,790
a single letter that's
repeated there.

40
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,465
We've seen that not a
occurs on both sides.

41
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,065
So we can immediately
say it's immediate.

42
00:01:42,065 --> 00:01:44,495
And bore line on top.

43
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:46,700
That deals with that side.

44
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,605
What happens on the other side?

45
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:50,450
Again, we got the all rule.

46
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,890
So we get this Nazi at

47
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,469
the beginning and a
not b and we replace,

48
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,394
we do both of those
with the resp repeated.

49
00:01:57,394 --> 00:01:59,990
So the first one is
the B and then the

50
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,650
Nazi that comes from left
hand side of the 4x,

51
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,330
and then whatever's on the right,

52
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,015
next one is the B, the B again.

53
00:02:08,015 --> 00:02:10,430
And then whatever
came on the right.

54
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,335
So now we're going to move that

55
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:14,690
see across while
moving that c across.

56
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,175
This gives me two
things on the right,

57
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:17,330
I might as well just write one of

58
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,010
them because this is a set.

59
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,040
If I look at that, I
can now move the a,

60
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,780
it's a not, so I move
it to the other side.

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,865
There's a stray comma
there, but never mind.

62
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,395
And once we have that,

63
00:02:27,395 --> 00:02:28,730
we can't go any further.

64
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,025
So we come down here and look
up what's happening here.

65
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,950
We had to be so we'll just
keep one of them and they

66
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,265
say we'll move over to the
left and that's the end.

67
00:02:37,265 --> 00:02:38,900
We can't go any further.

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,630
We can't do anything with this.

69
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,430
And well, this is the same,

70
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,079
but that's just by chance.

71
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,805
What does this tell me?

72
00:02:46,805 --> 00:02:49,790
Here? We know that
this is always valid.

73
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,450
So if this is valid,
tendencies apart,

74
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,090
in order to say
that this is valid,

75
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:57,890
we have to say that this one is

76
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,545
valid and this one's valid.

77
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:04,700
So we've got a much simpler
way of talking about this.

78
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,740
Let's suppose this is valid than

79
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,960
we've deduced that
these must be valid.

80
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,100
And in fact, since
they're the same,

81
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,215
but we've deduced that
this must be valid.

82
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,005
Similarly, if these are valid,

83
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:17,165
then we can track back down

84
00:03:17,165 --> 00:03:20,240
because these are all
double, double line rules.

85
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,770
And say this is valid,

86
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:27,395
this is valid if and only if
this is valid. It's magic.

87
00:03:27,395 --> 00:03:30,695
So the upshot of that is,

88
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:34,265
these things are valid
in some universe U,

89
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:37,835
if and only if this is
valid in that universe.

90
00:03:37,835 --> 00:03:42,755
That means effectively,
we've derived a new rule.

91
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,380
Has to be a bit silly to
have around as a rule

92
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,365
because this is rather
special purpose thing.

93
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:49,385
Why would we want it?

94
00:03:49,385 --> 00:03:52,100
But if it was some very
important thing to us,

95
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,585
we can have that there and say,

96
00:03:53,585 --> 00:03:56,900
actually, we've got a rule
that deals with this,

97
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,315
whatever that funny
combination is.

98
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:04,130
Okay? So this is a way that
you can make new rows.

99
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:06,650
If you're given
something like this,

100
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,240
you can make a rule that says,

101
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,640
how do I treat it when
it's on the right.

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,190
You could also take
something and put

103
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,440
it on the left of the
turnstile and then say,

104
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,900
how do I treat it when
it's on the left?

105
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,180
Using the same tricks?

106
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,800
And in this example, of course,

107
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,475
because those two things are
actually the same thing,

108
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:28,130
we can write it as that rule.

109
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,835
This also lets us

110
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:38,555
show when some complicated
expression is false,

111
00:04:38,555 --> 00:04:39,890
if I want to produce

112
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:43,175
a universe in which
this doesn't hold,

113
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:45,710
then I just need to produce

114
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,785
a universe where
this doesn't hold.

115
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:51,905
Because any universe
where this is valid,

116
00:04:51,905 --> 00:04:54,095
this is valid and vice versa.

117
00:04:54,095 --> 00:04:56,360
So if I make something
where this doesn't hold,

118
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,925
I know that in that
universe, this won't hope.

119
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:03,950
How do I make a comma b
satisfies, say not hold.

120
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,110
What kind of individual
Do I need to

121
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,510
show you to show that
that's not true?

122
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,670
Because remember
saying it holds is

123
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:13,160
to say for every individual,

124
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,975
if a and B are both properties
of that individual,

125
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,745
then c is a property.

126
00:05:19,745 --> 00:05:22,310
So in order to show
that that's not true,

127
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,920
we just needed to
produce one individual

128
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,700
for which a holds and p holds,

129
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,515
but C doesn't hold.

130
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:34,100
So how do we do that? Make
a world with an individual?

131
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,290
A is true, that
individual pay is true,

132
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,625
that individual and C is false
that you can, for example,

133
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,070
counterexample to that,
makes every antecedent,

134
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,170
everything on the left True,

135
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,880
and every succeeding false,

136
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,500
everything on the right false.

137
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,555
And then we've got
a counterexample

138
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:54,215
that will work to provide
a counterexample.

139
00:05:54,215 --> 00:05:58,550
Even if you've got 20
things on the right,

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,095
30 things on the left,

141
00:06:00,095 --> 00:06:02,240
nothing on the right,
nothing on the left.

142
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,270
Any number any number
as big as you like.

143
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,405
That's what it means to have
a counterexample is to say,

144
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:10,100
I'll give you something for

145
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,425
which everything on
the left is true.

146
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,765
Everything on the right is false.

147
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:17,240
The only time you
could get something

148
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,520
that looks a bit like this

149
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,640
and couldn't do that
would be the same.

150
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,955
Latter occurred both on
the left and the right.

151
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,575
But when the same letter

152
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:32,540
occurs both on the
left and the right,

153
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,950
then we can apply
the immediate rule.

154
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,345
So we'd never get one of those.

155
00:06:35,345 --> 00:06:39,965
If we end up with one
of these sequence,

156
00:06:39,965 --> 00:06:43,265
then we can always
produce a counterexample.

157
00:06:43,265 --> 00:06:45,800
If there are many of them
counterexample to any one of

158
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,380
them will be a counter-example
to what's at the bottom,

159
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,420
two different inference trees.

160
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,975
On the left, we've got
the first one we did.

161
00:06:53,975 --> 00:06:57,290
Every branch is terminated.

162
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,955
We think that this is a tree

163
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,620
that we draw the tree for you.

164
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,870
Trees start from
the ground and they

165
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,790
grow up and they have branches.

166
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,220
Cedar trees. That's what
a tree is mathematically.

167
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,980
The tree on the left,

168
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:19,640
every branch is terminated
by an immediate rule.

169
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,650
So we call those pieces of

170
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:24,080
the tree branches
paths ago of flight.

171
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,650
That sequent we started from
is valid in every universe.

172
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:28,805
That's what we get from that.

173
00:07:28,805 --> 00:07:31,610
On the other hand, we can
get a case like this where

174
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,795
some branches lead,
lead to leaves.

175
00:07:35,795 --> 00:07:39,170
And these leaves are
sequences with only atoms

176
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:42,170
because we couldn't get
rid of any connective.

177
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,910
There's a role for
it. So we just keep

178
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:46,399
applying the rules to be got
rid of all the connectives.

179
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,690
That's what simpler means.

180
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,300
We're making them simpler by
getting rid of connective.

181
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,690
If anatomy occurs on both sides,

182
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,070
then we can apply the immediate

183
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,435
rule so we don't get a leaf.

184
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,115
But if it doesn't,

185
00:07:58,115 --> 00:08:00,860
then we can make a counterexample
jaw starting sequence

186
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,780
is valid in some universe U,

187
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,020
if and only if each of
the leaves is valid.

188
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,160
To make it invalid,

189
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,965
we just have to invalidate
one of the leaves.

190
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:11,900
That gives you huge power.

191
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,430
I can make it very complicated

192
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,395
down the bottom and mechanically,

193
00:08:15,395 --> 00:08:18,095
just now, find the right rule.

194
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:20,870
Sometimes there will be more
than one rule that applies,

195
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,850
doesn't matter which
one you do first,

196
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,485
you will get an
equivalent answer.

197
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:27,020
Whichever way you do it, it
might take longer for you.

198
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,435
Sometimes if you choose
to do a branching thing

199
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:32,435
before you do a single
continuing one,

200
00:08:32,435 --> 00:08:34,100
you'll get there in
the end, it will

201
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,765
terminate. Why will it terminate?

202
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,104
Why does this procedure stop?

203
00:08:38,104 --> 00:08:40,220
How do I know I can get

204
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,210
some really tricky formula
where it will keep going.

205
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,280
I think the easiest
way is to talk

206
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,860
about the death of connectors.

207
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,450
We talk about, but not next to

208
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,355
pay years having
depth one let say.

209
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,570
And then if I put that together,

210
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,590
that's got depth true.

211
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,510
So we're talking about
how deeply nested

212
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,640
It is and the depth,

213
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,890
the maximum depth is coming
down cuz you always take

214
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,455
the maximum depth one
and get rid of it.

215
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,150
Now you bought
smaller ones and that

216
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,980
can only be finite
many of that depth.

217
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,735
So you'll get through all
those finite the many.

218
00:09:08,735 --> 00:09:10,250
And now you've taken
the depth down.

219
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,960
So you can write
that kind of proof.

220
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,180
All I want you to do is
not write down the proof.

221
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,920
I want you to really believe

222
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,870
it in your head that
this is going to stop.

223
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,220
It may get complicated.

224
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,875
You may need more paper,
but it will start it.

225
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,690
That's achieved what I want

226
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,940
you to get over in this lecture,

227
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,330
there are these roles with
the gammas and deltas.

228
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:30,635
The gammas and deltas

229
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:32,270
can be added to rules
because they're

230
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:35,420
just talking about some
particular sub universe.

231
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,945
I think Amazon deltas aren't
conceptually difficult.

232
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,480
The sense of what does it mean,

233
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,745
they just mean you're looking
at some sub universe.

234
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:46,280
They are very useful
because they enable you to

235
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,770
do proofs in ways you
couldn't without having them.

236
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,425
That this keeps track all
complicated arguments.

237
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:52,670
If this word then
we could look at

238
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,140
this sub universe and
that will be true.

239
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,460
And you don't need to do that.

240
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,550
You just manipulate the rules
and it's doing it for you.

241
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:01,955
And you can apply those
rules mechanically.

242
00:10:01,955 --> 00:10:06,019
And either you'll end up with
immediate rules everywhere.

243
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:08,630
In which case, the
thing you were talking

244
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:12,095
about is valid in every
universe or you weren't.

245
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:15,980
In which case, you will
find various sequence at

246
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,125
the top that enable
you to construct

247
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:21,930
counterexamples that show that
it's not valid everywhere.
