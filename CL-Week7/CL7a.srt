1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
Back to basics. Every
small triangle is read.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,515
We did that fine.

3
00:00:04,515 --> 00:00:07,620
Everyone's into catch on to
what was going on there.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,980
And we just translated those
things with and's and or's.

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
So every small triangles read,

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,280
some small triangle is red.

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,010
It looks to start with as
though this could get really

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,555
complicated because could
say lots of things here.

9
00:00:20,555 --> 00:00:23,000
So we're going to try and
make things simple because we

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,505
have these operations
on predicates.

11
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,065
Instead of thinking, oh, this is

12
00:00:27,065 --> 00:00:29,990
about three different predicates
and there might be one,

13
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,610
about four When I
add something else.

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,155
And finally, when I
get something else,

15
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:34,775
now I have one predicate here.

16
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:35,915
I'm, I'm predicate here.

17
00:00:35,915 --> 00:00:38,870
So I've made it simpler just
by using those operations.

18
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,010
If I want you to explain,

19
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:42,110
every small triangle is red,

20
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,580
then I load in eateries plane,

21
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,205
but every something is red means.

22
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:47,480
And now we're going
to look at another

23
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,740
example because we're going to

24
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,980
make it slightly
more complicated.

25
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,595
Will start from this,

26
00:00:55,595 --> 00:00:57,290
which is very simple.

27
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:59,360
We have a universe of

28
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,035
people and we have a
predicate is happy.

29
00:01:03,035 --> 00:01:06,450
And we want to say,
everybody is happy.

30
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,565
Where body, body be,

31
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:11,900
the collection of all people.

32
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,535
Just the words look nice.

33
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,745
Ok. Everybody is happy,

34
00:01:16,745 --> 00:01:18,950
is, and is happy.

35
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,205
X for the X is drawn from body.

36
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:24,800
That's even simpler than
what I just asked you about.

37
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,585
So I assume it's all right.

38
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,730
What I'm going to do now is to do

39
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,845
something that I assume
will not be o, right?

40
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,795
And you're welcome
to ask questions.

41
00:01:32,795 --> 00:01:34,460
I can say, okay,

42
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,250
I want to say something
like everybody is happy.

43
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,505
Say every xs is p,

44
00:01:40,505 --> 00:01:41,810
or every x in x,

45
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,920
this is p. Every x in
this list of xs has

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,170
property P. So I take the x

47
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,420
from the axis and
say it has be lipid.

48
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,090
Now, what I've done
now is to write

49
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,180
a function every,
what's its type?

50
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,069
It takes a list of things,

51
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:00,845
it takes a predicate on things,

52
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:02,765
and it gives me back a Boolean.

53
00:02:02,765 --> 00:02:04,610
I can now write,
instead of writing

54
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,950
all this stuff when I
have to translate that,

55
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,935
I can literally write that
Haskell and it works.

56
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:12,830
That's the game we're gonna
play mainly today is trying

57
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,725
to get Haskell to look
more like language.

58
00:02:15,725 --> 00:02:17,330
And it'll actually help us

59
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,625
explain what language
means by doing it.

60
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:23,180
We can say this.
We got every going

61
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,160
from a list of

62
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,755
the things we're talking
about, this predicate.

63
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,150
And then he just says, for

64
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,980
all the things you're
talking about, it's true.

65
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,270
The way we're going
to make things more

66
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,595
complicated is to move

67
00:02:34,595 --> 00:02:38,210
from predicates like
is happy or is red,

68
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,100
or is big or small,

69
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,705
to relations like loves
person, loves person.

70
00:02:44,705 --> 00:02:47,180
Any any resemblance to

71
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,715
person living or that is
totally coincidental.

72
00:02:49,715 --> 00:02:52,190
Loud asthma, Mary,
what does loves?

73
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,905
Mary main, if I write it down?

74
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:57,920
Well, we normally design

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,485
these things so that we
can use them in infix.

76
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:03,980
I love this, Mah Meri
really means my loves Mary.

77
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,645
If I just write loves Mark,

78
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:07,730
what type would
novice monogamy law.

79
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,589
This is just one of
these predicates.

80
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,440
It does from person
to person taboo.

81
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,365
And as we know, we know
it's brackets in there.

82
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:16,790
There could be packets

83
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,950
there and it would
make no difference.

84
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,595
So when we gave a person to
Love's, we get a predicate.

85
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:23,870
What does that predicate me?

86
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,115
Which people is it true of?

87
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:28,730
Suppose we put an X
in here for Mary,

88
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,255
then we'd have labs of x.

89
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:36,110
And log of x would
mean MA loves egg.

90
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:39,410
So loves mock means ma loves.

91
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,485
So a true of the people
who are loved PyMOL.

92
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:45,695
Now we got our every so
we can say everybody

93
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:49,550
loves MA what does
everybody loves Mark mean,

94
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,125
we haven't got it written
the right way yet.

95
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:52,820
At the moment it's written
in a confusing way,

96
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,735
but it'll get better.

97
00:03:53,735 --> 00:03:56,915
Lavas, Ma is true if
someone loves them.

98
00:03:56,915 --> 00:03:58,430
So what's it mean
to say it's true

99
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,860
of everybody loves everybody.

100
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,195
That's how we normally put it.

101
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:05,270
But because we've put
this partial application

102
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,020
here and now is the infix
version. It's mixed up.

103
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,825
Loves Mary is the same as Mark.

104
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:13,625
Loves Mary.

105
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,290
What you have to keep in mind.

106
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:24,230
So everybody loves Mark
is and of loves my X,

107
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,580
where X comes from body.

108
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:27,440
That's just the way
we defined everybody.

109
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,910
We take this predicate,

110
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,400
we apply to the axis and we
say it works for all of them.

111
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,500
So it means Matlab's everybody.

112
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,825
Haskell does something
really nice for us.

113
00:04:35,825 --> 00:04:39,020
Haskell has clever thing
is called sections A7.

114
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,090
I have something like loves,

115
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,114
which is a binary operator.

116
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:46,325
So here we've got
an infix binary.

117
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:50,150
Then if I write my loves
the parentheses around it,

118
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:54,140
it says, are you
thinking of this?

119
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,535
Man loves x, means mark Planet X.

120
00:04:58,535 --> 00:05:01,580
Now, this function works

121
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,010
the way we'd like it to
work. Loves everybody.

122
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,320
We can also do some
just the same way

123
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,690
as we done every same type.

124
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,010
It takes the list of things,

125
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,855
takes a predicate,
gives you a Boolean.

126
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:15,875
Some axes have property
p0 means for P of X,

127
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,540
X Fmax is, again,

128
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,895
you should remember that
from a few weeks ago.

129
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,785
If you remember a few
weeks ago anymore,

130
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:24,365
some body loves Mary,

131
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,650
should be o of b, loves Mary.

132
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,840
P comes from body.
Somebody loves Mary.

133
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,870
The way we can write
somebody loves Mary is

134
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,005
simply to say some body
loves Mary in brackets.

135
00:05:36,005 --> 00:05:39,095
You can do that section
on either side.

136
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:41,915
So let you fill in
either the right, left,

137
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:43,640
and make a function
out of the other path

138
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,650
until you learns about this,

139
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,890
you would have had to write a
function like this and say,

140
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,785
loves Mary is a function
from version to bool.

141
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,200
Love Mary of x is x loves Mary.

142
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,880
But because Haskell has this,

143
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,190
there is something
that is the function

144
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,580
which for an x gives you x
love Mary, it's this one.

145
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,725
The x is not even
mentioned in there.

146
00:06:03,725 --> 00:06:05,945
It's the thing you'd put
in to complete this.

147
00:06:05,945 --> 00:06:08,160
So those are sections.
