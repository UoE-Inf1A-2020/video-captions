1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
So far we've been
looking at logs of ones.

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,380
What happens if we have
two blocks of ones?

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,875
If we have two blocks of 1's,

4
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:18,315
then if not a and
not our way here.

5
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:23,550
And if a, and then we're here.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,195
So we have two blocks of 1s,

7
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:30,210
then we can make

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,470
the expression an
expression that represents

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,160
exactly this collection of

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,095
states by not a anatta
or a and r. Okay?

11
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:50,825
That's called a disjunctive

12
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:53,540
because there's a disjunction,
their normal form,

13
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,565
it's a disjunction of

14
00:00:55,565 --> 00:00:58,970
conjunctions of these
things called literals,

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,280
which are A's or nowadays as

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,100
not as letters or
their negations.

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,795
Disjunctive Normal Form,

18
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:08,915
disjunction of
conjunctions, of literals.

19
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,345
We take a pattern,
here's a pattern.

20
00:01:11,345 --> 00:01:13,040
We find some blocks.

21
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,930
Can anyone see
other blocks that I

22
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,060
haven't labeled blocks of ones?

23
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:20,315
We could do a
horizontal block here,

24
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,415
and we can do a
horizontal plot there.

25
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,590
Notice that we're keeping
as a power of two,

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,150
so it can only be two things,

27
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,010
but there are two
more two-piece blocks

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,335
that we could add when we,

29
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:32,075
when we made the normal form,

30
00:01:32,075 --> 00:01:36,574
each block we've got here will
correspond to are putting,

31
00:01:36,574 --> 00:01:38,585
this says what does this say?

32
00:01:38,585 --> 00:01:41,195
Can anyone work out
what's in common there?

33
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:43,400
In here, we are in this column,

34
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,780
so we're not a and not

35
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:48,724
G. And we're on one
of these two rows.

36
00:01:48,724 --> 00:01:51,005
They have in common
the zeros there.

37
00:01:51,005 --> 00:01:53,345
You see? So or not.

38
00:01:53,345 --> 00:01:55,940
So it will be not a,

39
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,220
not g, and not r,

40
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,305
or what would this one be?

41
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:03,320
Not b, not a and G and B.

42
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,545
Not a and G and B,

43
00:02:06,545 --> 00:02:07,910
because B is the second one of

44
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,890
these and it's true on those two.

45
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,900
And this one a and r,

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,050
because we got once
here and once the a

47
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,275
and R. So this is written
them in another order.

48
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,585
And which is that one?

49
00:02:20,585 --> 00:02:21,920
Pay not AIG.

50
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,430
Which one is that? It's this one.

51
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,460
And not a naught R naught
G, because the first one.
