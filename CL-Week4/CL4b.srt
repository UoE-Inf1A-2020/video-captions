1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
Here we have a and not a.

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:07,320
And they look quite
different on the diagram.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,050
But really, when we
do it algebraically,

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,090
not a is just
another proposition.

5
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,800
How can we picture it?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,680
So that we take
away the fact that

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,330
the diagram makes it
look as though there's

8
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,360
something special
about naught a and a.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,315
And the idea is, if
we do it on a plane,

10
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,030
we put a here and then
there's everything else.

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:30,010
Where could we do it where
that wouldn't happen?

12
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,330
Just think of the
surface of a sphere.

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,430
If we say a is in

14
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,140
the northern hemisphere and

15
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,030
not a is in the
Southern Hemisphere.

16
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,190
There's nothing special
about North and South.

17
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,570
We can look at it both ways and

18
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:46,010
it looks exactly the same.

19
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,825
If we take a circle,

20
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:51,245
not a great circle just to
circle around the globe is b.

21
00:00:51,245 --> 00:00:52,580
So we're saying the thing is that

22
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,860
this side of that circle P is

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,390
true and the things that

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,315
this side of that
circle P is false.

25
00:00:59,315 --> 00:01:02,015
This circle, the things that

26
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:04,850
this side of that
circle a is true,

27
00:01:04,850 --> 00:01:08,280
things this side is false.

28
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:14,330
So what happens if
we now look at this?

29
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,820
Here's a picture.

30
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,775
Or I'm asking you,

31
00:01:19,775 --> 00:01:24,380
is every AB or is every B a?

32
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,220
Here we have the circle

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,240
for a and things on
this side a true.

34
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,835
Here we have the circle for B.

35
00:01:34,835 --> 00:01:38,570
And the things on
this side, b is true.

36
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,940
Every B is a. But just
by the same token.

37
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,730
If we looked at it the other way.

38
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,815
Now you see that
every not a is not b.

39
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:53,360
Just by looking the other way.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,940
Sometimes it's helpful
to have pictures like

41
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,630
that enable you to see
relationships between things.

42
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,270
And say that actually
there is no difference

43
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,690
between saying every BSA

44
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:08,960
or every not a is not

45
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
v. It just depends

46
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,740
how we've chosen to
name those predicates.

47
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,525
One of them's called

48
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,340
the pathway and one of
them is called the miners.

49
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,420
But there's no real difference

50
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,950
between them is predicates.

51
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,130
Before we get onto something new.

52
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,745
Aristotle thought that
was very different

53
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:30,270
because the words he
used to say this,

54
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,680
every B is Nazi or no,

55
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,220
b is c. C said no BC.

56
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,720
He didn't mention Nazi.

57
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,865
And it didn't feel
like it was about

58
00:02:40,865 --> 00:02:42,020
the predicate Nazi

59
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,190
being a different one
from the one above.

60
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,735
He thought he was saying
something different.

61
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:46,445
So it's good to look
for patterns and

62
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:49,170
algebra helps us
see those patterns.
