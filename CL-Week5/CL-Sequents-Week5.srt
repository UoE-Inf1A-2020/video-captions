00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,900
To formalize Aristotle's theory

2
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,400
of syllogisms,
we introduced propositions

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,915
with this notation:
a satisfies b.

4
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:16,380
Which means in an
Euler diagram: here's

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,840
the universe and a
is contained in b.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,835
And if we want to say
that a does NOT satisfy b,

7
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,095
we must provide a
counterexample.

8
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:33,980
And a counterexample is
an x in the universe such

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,215
that a holds of x and b doesn't.

10
00:00:39,215 --> 00:00:43,250
That is, it's an x
for which a of x

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:48,334
is true and b of x is false.

12
00:00:48,334 --> 00:00:51,125
And here we're
mixing notation from

13
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,049
Haskell with the
mathematical notation.

14
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:56,120
But you should learn
to translate between

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,340
those two. Gentzen's sequents are

16
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,860
a simple but very
powerful generalization

17
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,440
of this. A sequent
looks very similar.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,050
It's talking about something and

19
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:09,934
says gamma satisfies delta.

20
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:14,570
But whereas here a and b are

21
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,970
predicates of type
u -> Bool, here

22
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,755
gamma and delta are finite
sets of predicates

23
00:01:24,755 --> 00:01:27,800
which we'll represent
in Haskell as

24
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,130
lists of things from u -> Bool.

25
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,400
And the easiest way to
explain what we mean by

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,770
gamma satisfies delta is to

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,500
say what we mean by
a counterexample.

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,740
So we will say that
gamma does not

29
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,685
satisfy delta if we
have a counterexample,

30
00:01:46,685 --> 00:01:49,775
which will be an x of type u

31
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:53,420
such that for all g in gamma,

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,750
because of course, gamma
is a list of predicates.

33
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:02,780
So for all predicates in
gamma, g of x equals true.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,335
And for all d in delta,
d of x equals false.

35
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:12,830
So a counterexample is
given by exhibiting

36
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:16,535
an x such that it satisfies
every g in gamma,

37
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:20,430
and it satisfies no d in delta.
