1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,145
We're going to look at
other forms of syllogism,

2
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:07,605
other forms of proposition.

3
00:00:07,605 --> 00:00:10,035
For instance, the syllogism,

4
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:11,880
all snakes are reptiles.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,085
No reptile has, therefore
no snake has for isn't.

6
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,884
In the Barbara form.

7
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:20,640
We'll formalize it
and we will see

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
later that this is
how it will look.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,410
But before we can do that,

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,030
we've got to understand how do we

11
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,810
say no snake has for what does

12
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,630
that proposition look
like and how does it

13
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,950
relate to propositions
like every ASB?

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,180
All of Aristotle's propositions
relate to predicates.

15
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,130
The simplest kind
which you've already

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,490
seen is called
universal affirmation.

17
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,605
A corresponds to every
a is B, or all a are B.

18
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:54,770
And the examples we've seen
are all men are mortal.

19
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,190
Socrates is a man where
we created a predicate,

20
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,440
which was being Socrates,

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,590
to allow us to put
that in the form of

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,895
a proposition, a
universal affirmation.

23
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:11,090
We introduce this symbol.

24
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,990
And we introduced
the representation

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,300
of this in the Venn
diagram by saying

26
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,730
that the area that will be

27
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,110
inhabited by things that
are a and not B is empty.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:27,230
The proposition all a is B

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,500
is valid in whatever
universe we're looking at.

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,600
If there's no counterexample,

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,265
this region is empty,

32
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:36,455
we use this notation.

33
00:01:36,455 --> 00:01:38,750
A satisfies B and it

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,180
corresponds to saying
the set of x such

35
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,310
that a of x is contained

36
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,340
in the set of x such that p of x.

37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,480
We're now going to look at

38
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,565
another region and say
that this is empty.

39
00:01:55,565 --> 00:02:00,830
So the proposition here
says that no a is B.

40
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,370
A counter-example
to that would be

41
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,390
an example where some a is B.

42
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,970
So if this region,

43
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:18,680
things that are both a and
B is empty, then no ASB.

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,765
That's the same as saying
that every a is not b.

45
00:02:23,765 --> 00:02:25,430
So in our notation,

46
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,405
we say every a is NOT B

47
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:35,045
in English is more natural
sometimes to say no a is B.

48
00:02:35,045 --> 00:02:37,505
We now have two forms
of proposition.

49
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:40,595
We have the original
universal affirmation.

50
00:02:40,595 --> 00:02:42,335
Every a is b,

51
00:02:42,335 --> 00:02:45,560
which says that this region
of the Venn diagram is

52
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,685
empty and we have
universal denial.

53
00:02:49,685 --> 00:02:52,925
Every a is not B or no ASB,

54
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:57,180
which says that this
region is empty.
