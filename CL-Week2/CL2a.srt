1
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,825
In this video, we start on

2
00:00:06,825 --> 00:00:11,100
the main preoccupation
of logic deduction.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,345
The ways in which we
can derive console.

4
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:19,350
We can derive consequences
from assumptions.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:21,930
We assume that some
things are true.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,075
And then by logical reasoning,
we derive conclusions.

7
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:29,010
This goes back to Aristotle,

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,650
and we're going to
start this course with

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,980
a Valley quake introduction
to Aristotelian syllogisms.

10
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:39,770
We'll use them to
introduce some of

11
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,065
the notation that we'll use

12
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:44,615
in a broader setting
of modern logic.

13
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:49,130
And the basic ideas of
the relationship between

14
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:55,670
models and reality will
start using simple diagrams,

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,470
known as Euler diagrams.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,290
But surely diagram is like this,

17
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:02,630
were drawn long
before Euler error.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:05,075
A couple of Euler diagrams.

19
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:09,665
This one shows a
universe of things.

20
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:15,335
And then three collections
or subsets of things.

21
00:01:15,335 --> 00:01:18,245
Didn't that? And in
this first example,

22
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,660
a is contained in B,

23
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,160
is contained in C. A
very simple arrangement.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,985
We think of these subsets is
corresponding to properties.

25
00:01:28,985 --> 00:01:31,190
So the things inside this circle,

26
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,455
other things with the property a,

27
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,000
is inside this circle with

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,710
the property P and
this circle with

29
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:40,730
the property C. And when
we say a property a,

30
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:45,695
we mean that for each
individual in the universe,

31
00:01:45,695 --> 00:01:49,400
we can tell whether it has
the property a or not.

32
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,180
So we say a hold of that
individual is true,

33
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,330
or a hold of that
individual is false.

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,010
Here's a different configuration

35
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:03,350
of properties in a universe.

36
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,680
In this case, a,

37
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,440
having the property a means you

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,350
don't have the
properties brilliancy.

39
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,880
It's still the case that

40
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,265
the bees are contained
in the seas.

41
00:02:16,265 --> 00:02:19,730
What Aristotle did was
to codify these kinds of

42
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,950
relationships and will count

43
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,140
some rules of inference
between them.

44
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,080
That's the introduction
of deduction.

45
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,030
And the very first example,

46
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,560
which is probably familiar to you

47
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,155
already is this syllogism.

48
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:35,000
Socrates is a man.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,815
All men are mortal.

50
00:02:36,815 --> 00:02:39,170
Therefore Socrates is mortal.

51
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:42,605
That corresponds to this pattern.

52
00:02:42,605 --> 00:02:46,655
If we say a is the property
of being Socrates,

53
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:49,925
B is the property of being a man,

54
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,700
and C is the property
of being mortal.

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,605
Socrates is a man,

56
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:59,015
represents the statement
that a is contained in B.

57
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:01,130
All men are mortal is

58
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:04,580
the statement that v
is contained in C,

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,610
and obviously a is contained
in C. Socrates is mortal.

60
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:14,930
You may want to think about
what kinds of properties are

61
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,240
represented here
and what kinds of

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,065
deductions you might
make between them.

63
00:03:21,065 --> 00:03:23,450
We're going to introduce

64
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:26,090
some mathematical notation for

65
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,965
talking about these things.

66
00:03:27,965 --> 00:03:29,630
Because doing it in

67
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,465
natural language
becomes quite involved.

68
00:03:32,465 --> 00:03:34,370
We want to make it much easier.

69
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,520
And using modern
mathematical notations and

70
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,209
some algebra will
allow us to do things.

71
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,095
Easily that were quite
hard even for Aristotle.

72
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:46,910
First of all, we have

73
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,355
this mathematical notation for

74
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:51,635
subsets of the individuals.

75
00:03:51,635 --> 00:03:55,640
So this is the set of x
such that x is Socrates.

76
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,830
That represents the things

77
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:00,185
with the property being Socrates.

78
00:04:00,185 --> 00:04:03,635
This is the set of x
such that x is a man.

79
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:07,850
The set of man is a subset
of our universe of objects.

80
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:11,840
This set is contained
in this set.

81
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,570
The set of things which a man is

82
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,555
contained in the set of
things which are motile.

83
00:04:17,555 --> 00:04:22,085
And we conclude, because this
set is contained in this,

84
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,005
this is contained in this,

85
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,520
and it's a property of sets

86
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,010
that containment is transitive.

87
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,870
That means the set of things that

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,490
Socrates is contained in,

89
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,975
the set of things
that are mortal.

90
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:36,770
We're going to try and
represent everything uniformly.

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,370
So this says the set of x
such that x equals Socrates.

92
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,860
That says the set of x such
that is a man is true of x.

93
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,810
We want to be able to put
everything in this form

94
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,060
where these things are
called predicates.

95
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,590
Predicates are functions that

96
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,735
given an element of the universe,

97
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:56,450
gave us a truth
value, true or false.

98
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,155
So rather than writing
this as x equals Socrates,

99
00:05:00,155 --> 00:05:01,685
we want to write it as,

100
00:05:01,685 --> 00:05:03,575
is Socrates x.

101
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,905
Where is Socrates?

102
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:08,875
Is the property of
an x that is true

103
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:12,055
if x happens to be
Socrates and is false.

104
00:05:12,055 --> 00:05:16,525
Otherwise. When we come
to do things in Haskell,

105
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,180
it will be very important
to do this kind of

106
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,850
trick to make everything
of the same type.

107
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,320
So these predicates,

108
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,305
these functions from
things to Booleans,

109
00:05:26,305 --> 00:05:28,900
will be our basic way of

110
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,320
representing
properties in Haskell.

111
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,540
If we now look at this
pattern of inference,

112
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,980
we have everything that
is Socrates is a man.

113
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,135
Everything that is
a man is immortal.

114
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:48,985
Therefore, everything that
is Socrates is mortal.

115
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:52,225
And we abstract from
that and say for

116
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:56,180
any properties a, B, and C,

117
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,740
which have this form, that is,

118
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,950
every a is b and every B
is C, satisfy this role.

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,349
That then every ASE.

120
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:10,870
And that's again just
this containment and

121
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,699
that obvious fact that
we're trying to unpick.

122
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,525
So we can generalize to
other forms of argument.

123
00:06:19,525 --> 00:06:21,880
We're not going to use

124
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,194
Euler diagrams when we
generalize to other examples,

125
00:06:25,194 --> 00:06:27,505
it's easier to use Venn diagrams.

126
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:31,010
The Venn diagram looks
quite like an oil.

127
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,165
A diagram with an
important difference.

128
00:06:35,165 --> 00:06:39,875
This Venn diagram represents
three properties.

129
00:06:39,875 --> 00:06:41,525
Let's call them a, B,

130
00:06:41,525 --> 00:06:46,490
and C. And all

131
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,960
possible relations between
them in the sense of terror.

132
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,865
Eight regions here.

133
00:06:52,865 --> 00:06:55,190
And each region represents

134
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:57,020
a combination of
those properties.

135
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,900
The things out here satisfy
No, the properties.

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,350
These things satisfy
only a, these only B,

137
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,315
and these only see these a and B,

138
00:07:08,315 --> 00:07:13,960
B and C and a and C. And
they satisfy all three,

139
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,415
a and B and C. And
rather than represent

140
00:07:18,415 --> 00:07:24,520
the world by not drawing
regions which are empty,

141
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,850
we're going to use
Venn diagrams and use

142
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,420
this shading to indicate
that the region is empty.

143
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,250
So in this Venn diagram,

144
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,545
I've said that this region,

145
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:38,440
the places where a is true,

146
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,915
but B is not true.

147
00:07:40,915 --> 00:07:42,925
This region is empty.

148
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:45,339
That says there are no things

149
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,325
where a is true
and B is not true.

150
00:07:48,325 --> 00:07:50,215
Which is the same as saying

151
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:53,895
everything which
does have a is here.

152
00:07:53,895 --> 00:07:58,175
Which means everything
in a is in B.

153
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:02,120
So this is another way of
representing our every ASP.

154
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,520
If we look at this example, here,

155
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:10,085
we've colored the region where
a is true and C is true.

156
00:08:10,085 --> 00:08:13,475
So there's nothing
such that both a

157
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:17,630
and c. That means the,

158
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,210
as soon as we know
something's in a,

159
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,100
we know it's not in c,

160
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,935
because if it were, it
would lie in this region.

161
00:08:24,935 --> 00:08:26,675
And we've decided that is empty.

162
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:29,885
So this represents nothing in a,

163
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:32,885
is in C, no AC.

164
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:35,120
And we now go back to

165
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,395
our universe of
disks and triangles.

166
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,465
We looked at these statements.

167
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:43,340
And you recall, when we looked at

168
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,590
every red triangle is small.

169
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,875
We decided that that was true

170
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:53,135
because this region is empty.

171
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:55,970
And what we're going to
do is to use this in

172
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,015
the context of general
Venn diagrams.

173
00:08:59,015 --> 00:09:03,450
In order to reason
about syllogisms.

174
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,610
Will take these Venn
diagrams and think of

175
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,895
the individuals are sitting
in the various regions.

176
00:09:10,895 --> 00:09:13,595
This is every a is b,

177
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,860
and this is no a is B.

178
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,750
You can write the
corresponding Euler diagrams

179
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,910
for these two Venn diagrams.
