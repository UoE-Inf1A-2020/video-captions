1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,545
No a is B is exactly the same

2
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:08,835
as no B is a on an Euler diagram,

3
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:13,050
no a is B is represented
by two disjoint circles.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,295
And of course, whether we look at

5
00:00:14,295 --> 00:00:18,495
a first Toby First is
destroyed that disjoint.

6
00:00:18,495 --> 00:00:21,270
We're going to look
at more examples

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,420
of that kind of relationship now.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,915
So we're looking at
negation of predicates.

9
00:00:27,915 --> 00:00:34,810
And if we look at some Venn
diagrams on this top row,

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,600
various regions being empty.

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:42,410
And then look at the mirror image

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,730
of each of those diagrams.

13
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:47,900
So here we have a on the
left and be on the right.

14
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,625
But here we have B on the
left and a on the right.

15
00:00:52,625 --> 00:00:57,485
So if we swap a and b here,

16
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,660
we arrive at a diagram that looks

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,940
exactly the same
as we had before.

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,530
This tells us that
if every a is not b,

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:10,595
it's the same as saying
every B is not a or

20
00:01:10,595 --> 00:01:15,810
no a is b is the same
as saying no B is a.

21
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:23,345
This example is a little
more difficult to translate.

22
00:01:23,345 --> 00:01:25,340
But if we swap these,

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,140
then we put a over here.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,000
We have a here,

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,249
we move it to the other side.

26
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:40,295
Then this says all
A's BY every a is B.

27
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:43,790
So that says if I
have something in a,

28
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,590
it must be in B because

29
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,540
this bit is empty,
it can't be that.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,015
This says if we
start with p here,

31
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,685
if I have something and
not be in other words,

32
00:01:55,685 --> 00:02:00,410
outside B, then it can't be here.

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,920
I have something not
in B, which is this.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,085
And it's definitely not in a.

35
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,605
So every not b is not a.

36
00:02:09,605 --> 00:02:12,840
So no not b is a.

37
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,105
Here I have the third possibility

38
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:20,495
of a kind of region
that can be excluded.

39
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:22,355
We exclude these.

40
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:27,725
It says anything that's
not in a must be in be.

41
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,020
It can't be outside be.

42
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,760
That's exactly the same as

43
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,310
saying everything that's not in

44
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,090
B is in a or not a is b is
the same as all not b is a.

45
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,150
If we look at each
of these examples,

46
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,895
we can swap the sides of the two.

47
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:49,220
And as we swap the sides,

48
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,745
we add an negation
or take one away.

49
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:56,660
Taking negation away really
is the same as adding one.

50
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,965
Because if I take a
and then negate it,

51
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:02,735
and then negate it again,

52
00:03:02,735 --> 00:03:05,070
I get back to way.

53
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,465
So in these relationships we
can say when we swap them,

54
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,070
we add an negation.

55
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,290
And if that gives us
a double negation,

56
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:18,960
not, not is something
we can ignore.

57
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,645
This is the first rule
of Boolean algebra.

58
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:28,160
Here we have an
operation not a and not,

59
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,150
not a equals a, just
like arithmetic,

60
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,540
where we have an operation minus,

61
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,420
which takes the negative
of a number and

62
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,120
minus minus a is equal to a.

63
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,440
So negation behaves in the
same way as the minus sign for

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,910
number is the first rule
of Boolean algebra,

65
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,370
but it's really the second
rule of Boolean logic.

66
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,735
The first rule of Boolean logic
is our syllogism Barbara.

67
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:59,225
We've written a to these roles

68
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:01,295
with the double horizontal line.

69
00:04:01,295 --> 00:04:04,325
That means that the rules were
purged from top to bottom.

70
00:04:04,325 --> 00:04:06,620
If every a is B,

71
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:10,025
then every not b is not a.

72
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,125
But they also work
from bottom to top.

73
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,495
If every not b is not a,

74
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:17,060
then every a is B.

75
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,585
Because if we just
had this single rule,

76
00:04:20,585 --> 00:04:22,700
then once we know that not,

77
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,575
not a is the same as any,

78
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:25,790
we can get the data rule.

79
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,045
We can say apply
the single rule to

80
00:04:29,045 --> 00:04:33,320
every ISP to get not
b is not a fine.

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,115
But if I now apply the
single rule again,

82
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:38,720
then I get every not,

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,550
not a is not not B,

84
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,610
but then I replace
these double negations.

85
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,190
Nothing. So I can go from

86
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,580
here to here using
the double negation.

87
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:54,090
So from this one rule we
can derive both ways.

88
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,110
Are algebraic. Notation
makes it much easier for us

89
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:06,755
to do some of these things
than it was for Aristotle.

90
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:10,220
Aristotle just talking
about negation,

91
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,105
not says to every
affirmation neck

92
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,775
corresponds exactly
one denial such that,

93
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:21,334
that denial denies exactly
what the affirmation of firms.

94
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:24,905
It's getting quite convoluted.

95
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,469
And thinking these
things through without

96
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,445
the algebraic notation
can be quite difficult.

97
00:05:31,445 --> 00:05:34,640
And we'll see you in
our next syllogism

98
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,000
that the algebra really
does give us for

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,370
free somethings that
perplexed logicians over

100
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,560
millennia between the times of

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,130
Aristotle and van to recap,

102
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,645
where are we now?

103
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:57,455
We have predicates a and B.
Predicates are functions,

104
00:05:57,455 --> 00:06:00,605
but they can also
be viewed as sets.

105
00:06:00,605 --> 00:06:02,720
And when we draw
the Venn diagrams,

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,725
we're representing them
as pictures of sets.

107
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:08,300
We have this relation,

108
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,535
every a satisfies B,

109
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:13,715
which is a relation
between predicates.

110
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,580
We've introduced negation.

111
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,305
A predicates a function.

112
00:06:18,305 --> 00:06:20,015
I can take a predicate

113
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:23,255
a and apply it to x
to get a truth value.

114
00:06:23,255 --> 00:06:26,090
I can say not of
that truth value,

115
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,110
not false is true or
not of true is false.

116
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:36,034
So the negation of a as a
predicate when applied to x,

117
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,990
takes the truth value
of a applied to

118
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,365
X and then negates that
applies not to it.

119
00:06:42,365 --> 00:06:45,665
And not, not a is the same as a.

120
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:51,070
We have our rule,

121
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,459
Barbara, which is like this.

122
00:06:54,459 --> 00:06:57,955
And just a slight look ahead.

123
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:00,280
That means we have
a rule like this

124
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,015
because if for every predicate,

125
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:07,060
we have a predicate
which is called Not a,

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,795
then if this rule works
for any predicate,

127
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:14,875
it works not only for
C But for not see.

128
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:19,285
The other thing we have is
these contour positions.

129
00:07:19,285 --> 00:07:26,230
Anywhere where I have a satisfies
not B. I can replace it

130
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,485
by b satisfies not a

131
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:34,580
without changing the
validity of the proposition.

132
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,330
Similarly, wherever I
have a satisfies B,

133
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,210
I have not B satisfies
no day wherever I

134
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,450
have nodejs satisfies
B, I have not.

135
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,085
B satisfies a.

136
00:07:46,085 --> 00:07:48,420
So this is contraposition.
