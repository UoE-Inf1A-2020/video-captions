1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,070
When we were doing that,

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:06,450
we were writing things down
like a and B and not B.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,715
And these are talking
about actual predicate.

4
00:00:10,715 --> 00:00:12,870
So I'm thinking of
those just the way

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,780
when you write in algebra,

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,780
you write down things
like a squared minus b,

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,360
x plus c. But they're
really talking

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:24,300
about numbers set quite
often in algebra,

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,860
we just think of
ourselves as dealing with

10
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,745
equations and we're
gonna do the same.

11
00:00:27,745 --> 00:00:30,200
It's logic. Are we going
to do it a bit more

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,320
formally than you
normally do in algebra?

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,970
So far, we've been
treating logic just

14
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,620
the same way as you
normally use algebra.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,730
We're talking about things.

16
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,915
We write connectives down.

17
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,040
When we interpret it,

18
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,800
we give values to the variables.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,575
For us, the values
were predicates.

20
00:00:45,575 --> 00:00:48,065
The operators were and are not.

21
00:00:48,065 --> 00:00:51,409
Here. The values are
numbers, the operators,

22
00:00:51,409 --> 00:00:55,130
multiplication and so forth.
But it's very similar.

23
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,785
We've talked about
predicates because

24
00:00:57,785 --> 00:01:01,340
they enable you to
have this picture of

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:05,420
every a is b means the
collection of things that have

26
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,370
the property a is contained

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,310
in the collection of things
that have the property B.

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,074
You have a nice picture of
this inclusion relation.

29
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,620
And actually everything has come

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,330
out of that inclusion relation.

31
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,920
The way we axiomatize where
we gave the roles for and,

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,225
and or was by looking at that
picture and saying, well,

33
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:28,040
how do we describe the way

34
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,755
the intersection of
these two things work?

35
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:33,890
Some things contained in the
intersection if and only

36
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,090
if it's contained in

37
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,010
both of the things you
were intersecting.

38
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:38,765
And similarly with all
the other way round,

39
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,705
the union is contained
in something.

40
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,670
If each of the things in

41
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,710
that union is contained
in something,

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,510
what I want to do now is

43
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,430
to look at it

44
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,965
slightly differently because
we can simplify things.

45
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,380
We don't need to think
of all Universities

46
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,610
where there might be millions

47
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,840
of them and these
people and stuff,

48
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,720
we can apply our stuff
to those universes.

49
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,205
But when we're working,

50
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:04,460
we can actually focus
down and look at

51
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,330
a much smaller set of things
to see what's going on.

52
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,370
Let's just see what we've done.

53
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,755
We've got predicates.

54
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:14,780
We've got various operations on

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,315
predicates like and, and, or.

56
00:02:17,315 --> 00:02:21,395
And. We have these
subsets as predicates.

57
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,030
Propositions are predicates.

58
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,775
There just functions
from U to blue.

59
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:29,915
And we can lift the
logical operations,

60
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:34,520
like not up to operations
on predicates.

61
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,365
And we've done the same friend.

62
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,729
And that's quite confusing,

63
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:39,080
but it's something
you really should

64
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,820
keep looking and get
your head around because

65
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,590
it's a very important
idea that we

66
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,765
lift the operations from

67
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:47,585
just operations on Boolean values

68
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:50,990
to operations on
predicates or sets.

69
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,045
How many things are there?

70
00:02:53,045 --> 00:02:55,220
How many properties?

71
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,365
We don't actually need to look at

72
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:59,465
everything that might be,

73
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:01,460
because we're going
to treat things the

74
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,910
same if they're the same for
the properties we've got.

75
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,410
So this is a principle.

76
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,180
Leibnitz protein.

77
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,860
Lipid says, well, what does it

78
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,900
mean to say there are two things.

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,430
If there are two
things, you need to be

80
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,960
able to tell the
difference between them.

81
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,400
So if you can't tell the
difference that the same.

82
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,574
And we're going to
use that principle,

83
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:23,360
but we're going to use it in the,

84
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,580
in the formal setting off.

85
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,930
If we're just talking
about five properties,

86
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:32,420
then we can only ever need

87
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,190
a universe that has two to

88
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,560
the fifth different individuals.

89
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,790
Because that was the only

90
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,710
different possibilities
we can have.

91
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,270
And as far as we're concerned,

92
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,820
either we have something
with that combination of

93
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,560
properties or we don't have

94
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,005
something with that
combination of properties.

95
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:53,360
Here you see, we say end is done

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:04:01,055
on properties by extending this,

97
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:07,140
lifting it up to this
to get that's a and b.

98
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,810
That a or B.

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,125
But in general, when we do that,

100
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:22,115
we just get some collection
of these regions.

101
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:27,620
Each part of this is either
in our property or it's not.

102
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,245
So we only need
one representative

103
00:04:30,245 --> 00:04:32,225
for each of those things.

104
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:35,090
So I've now label these.

105
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,090
There is no label in
the white PIT outside

106
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,655
because none of the
properties is true.

107
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:45,935
This is a Venn diagram
for four variables.

108
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:47,930
And these are the various labels

109
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,760
where these are the
things that are true.

110
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,055
So right in the
middle that as ABCD,

111
00:04:52,055 --> 00:04:53,630
all four of them are true.

112
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,160
Elsewhere, there
are a lot of things

113
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,525
with three of them true.

114
00:04:56,525 --> 00:04:58,940
Withdraw them true, with
only one of them true,

115
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,620
and then outside with
none of them true.

116
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:09,125
Ok. So these things can be
labeled just with here.

117
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,825
A is true, P is false,

118
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:13,955
C is false, and this is true.

119
00:05:13,955 --> 00:05:19,160
All we need to look
at is individuals.

120
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,159
Like this. As an individual,

121
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:23,690
which we'll call tau false,

122
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,580
false true as an individual

123
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,680
which we'll call false,
false, true, true.

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,205
If we have those individuals,
that's all we need.

125
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,290
Cost terror, the labels a, b, c,

126
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,080
d. So what are these?

127
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,780
For each of my variables,

128
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,535
I got a truth value.

129
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:46,340
So each one of these could
be done as a list of pairs.

130
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,980
It could play a is
true, b is true,

131
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,240
c is false, or it could be
besides just the function.

132
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,310
So again, we're going
to use functions.

133
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,305
There's going to be
called valuations.

134
00:05:57,305 --> 00:06:01,170
And that's where I'm going to
stop for today. Thank you.
