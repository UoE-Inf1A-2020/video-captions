1
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:09,940
Now we're ready to work
through our first example of

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,215
a syllogism using Venn diagrams.

3
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:16,150
Socrates is a man.

4
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,380
All men are mortal.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:19,314
Therefore Socrates is mortal.

6
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:22,314
That's just an instance
of this general pattern.

7
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,740
If all ILP and all
PAC than all IRC,

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:30,865
we're going to use Venn
diagrams to represent that.

9
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:34,510
The first thing is to
understand what it means on

10
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,725
a Venn Diagram to say
that all a are B.

11
00:00:38,725 --> 00:00:44,250
Where we've seen this too
predicate Venn diagram before.

12
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,365
If every a is b,

13
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:52,415
and we use this notation
to say that every ASB,

14
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:57,200
so all ARP is a turnstile B.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,540
If every a is b,

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,965
it's the same as saying,

17
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:03,410
no a is not B.

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,120
That's the same as saying

19
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,015
that the region in
the Venn diagram

20
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:13,535
where I would put anything
which is a but not B is empty.

21
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:16,985
No individual is a and not B.

22
00:01:16,985 --> 00:01:21,215
This region of the
Venn diagram is empty.

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:24,890
If we now want to show that
our syllogism is sound,

24
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:29,300
we assume that in the
diagram for a and b,

25
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,175
this region is empty.

26
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:33,680
In the diagram for B and C,

27
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,899
This region is empty.

28
00:01:35,899 --> 00:01:38,750
We have to argue that
if that's empty and

29
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,335
that's empty than in the
diagram for a and C,

30
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,760
This region is empty.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,080
In order to do that, we'll

32
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,930
rearrange our diagrams
a little bit.

33
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,300
We want to take the information

34
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,535
here and the information here,

35
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:59,630
combine it to conclude
that that is empty.

36
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,225
So this is empty, this is empty.

37
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:04,460
We want to combine
those two facts

38
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,870
to show that this is empty.

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,840
What we do is to take

40
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,225
the two binary Venn
diagrams and overlay them.

41
00:02:16,225 --> 00:02:18,550
Now I'm making use of the codes

42
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,770
that I had before to label

43
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:26,365
the eight regions of this
three element Venn diagram.

44
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:29,035
In a three element Venn diagram,

45
00:02:29,035 --> 00:02:32,545
we have 0 to seven is
eight possibilities.

46
00:02:32,545 --> 00:02:35,395
And the venn diagram
represents the mole.

47
00:02:35,395 --> 00:02:40,390
The hypothesis that this
region is empty says

48
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,045
the regions 45 of the three
predicate diagram or empty.

49
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:51,110
The hypothesis that this region

50
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,610
is empty tells us that
regions 26 are empty.

51
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,395
So we know that 45 are
empty and 26 are empty.

52
00:03:00,395 --> 00:03:03,305
But this region
corresponds to 46.

53
00:03:03,305 --> 00:03:05,330
So four is empty because this one

54
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,150
was six is empty
because this one was,

55
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:11,105
the union of 46 is empty.

56
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,580
That's our first syllogism.

57
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,365
Its name is Barbara,

58
00:03:15,365 --> 00:03:18,620
and the reason for the
name will come to later.

59
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,230
We say this rule is sound.

60
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,869
What does it mean to
say a rule is sound?

61
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:26,270
It says for any predicates a, b,

62
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,435
and c in any universe.

63
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:33,230
If the premises are
valid in that universe,

64
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,940
then the conclusion is
valid in that universe.

65
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,050
To recap, we represent
the fact that

66
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,885
every ASB by saying that
this region x is empty,

67
00:03:47,885 --> 00:03:53,044
every B is C tells us
this region why is empty.

68
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:58,070
And then basically we infer
that zed is empty because

69
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:03,875
z is contained in the
union of X and Y.

70
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:10,590
Our syllogism in
Barbara is sound.
