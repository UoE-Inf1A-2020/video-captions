00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:03,180
Hello. The statements were

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,219
introduced in the previous video,

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,115
are actually classical statements

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,700
introduced into
logic by Aristotle.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,680
And they form what are known

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,140
as his categorical propositions.

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:18,735
They say every a is b.

8
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:22,080
Now ASB, some ASB.

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,750
Aristotle was the
first to try and

10
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,260
formalize arguments
using statements.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,995
We saw last time that
in our universe,

12
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:34,260
every red triangle is small.

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,080
And it is not the case that
every small triangle is red.

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,090
I want to do here
is to discuss in

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,615
a little more detail
how we tell that.

16
00:00:44,615 --> 00:00:46,685
We want to analyze.

17
00:00:46,685 --> 00:00:50,310
How did we decide
that that's the case?

18
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,175
So we're going to look at
every red triangle is small.

19
00:00:58,175 --> 00:01:01,280
And we're going to look at it
in terms of a Venn diagram.

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,975
So we're talking here about

21
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:07,700
the triangles which we've
put inside this circle.

22
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,114
The red things that we
put inside this circle,

23
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,290
and the small things
that we've put

24
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:18,080
inside this faint circle.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,950
If there were red triangle,

26
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,225
that was not small
way would we find it?

27
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:29,585
We want to look at
the red triangles.

28
00:01:29,585 --> 00:01:31,760
So the red triangles fall in

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,405
this part of the Venn diagram.

30
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:38,720
So we take the red
triangles and then we

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,125
look at the things that is small.

32
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,120
This place here is where we would

33
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:49,700
put anything that was a
counterexample to this.

34
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,000
Um, because there are
no counter-examples,

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,620
it's true that every
red triangle is small.

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,570
We can do something similar
for all of the others.

37
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:07,175
Every small triangle is read it,

38
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:10,085
every small triangle is red.

39
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:15,110
Then we take the small
triangles so that

40
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,465
these small triangles
and were true,

41
00:02:20,465 --> 00:02:23,719
we would have found
that this was empty.

42
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:25,580
We can see that it's

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,995
not the case that every
small triangle is right,

44
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:29,930
because there is
something in here.

45
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,700
And that would have
to be empty to

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,920
have every small
triangle being read.

47
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,980
Now we move to the next one.

48
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,065
Some big triangle is amber.

49
00:02:43,065 --> 00:02:46,025
Look now at the big triangles.

50
00:02:46,025 --> 00:02:50,945
They are the things that
are in the triangles,

51
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:54,140
but not in the small.

52
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,260
So these is the big triangles.

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,199
Some big triangle is amber.

54
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:02,375
Here are the amber things.

55
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:07,985
And because there is something
in here, this is true.

56
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:11,285
To show that some began
to triangle is Amber.

57
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:15,180
We showed that a particular
region is inhabited.

58
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,720
The next one is some
small, this is red.

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,660
We then take the small disks.

60
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,065
Here are the disks and
here are the small things.

61
00:03:29,065 --> 00:03:34,105
These are the small
disks, small disk.

62
00:03:34,105 --> 00:03:36,130
And if one of them were red,

63
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,385
this will be inhabited.
But it's not.

64
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,650
So, it's not inhabited.

65
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,450
So this is false.

66
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,200
No red thing is blue
will be our next.

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:56,995
So let's look at the red
things and the blue things.

68
00:03:56,995 --> 00:04:01,525
And to say that no
red thing is blew,

69
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:05,950
all we need to do is
to say this is empty.

70
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,445
That tells us that no
red thing is blue.

71
00:04:09,445 --> 00:04:11,335
When we looked at these,

72
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:13,060
we looked at red triangles and

73
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,109
small triangles and big
triangle's small disks.

74
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:20,425
And we had three predicates
to deal with at once.

75
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:23,035
But actually, if we think of

76
00:04:23,035 --> 00:04:24,160
red triangle is

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,545
a predicate and small
triangle is a predicate.

78
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:28,210
A big triangle is a predicate

79
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,265
and small disk is a predicate.

80
00:04:30,265 --> 00:04:35,080
Then the kind of reasoning
we've done here with

81
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,210
just two circles will be

82
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:41,750
enough to check all these
kinds of statement.

83
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,070
And we'll see that next time.
