1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,030
In the last video, we
introduced binary questions.

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,770
And now we're going to use

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:07,570
binary questions to form what

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:09,595
are known as decision trees.

5
00:00:09,595 --> 00:00:12,895
We're going to take the
chess set as an example.

6
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:16,990
A chess set has 32 pieces
of 12 different kinds.

7
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,680
There are black and white
pieces, 16 of each.

8
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,695
Within each of those,
there's one king,

9
00:00:23,695 --> 00:00:26,335
one queen, two bishops,

10
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:30,100
two knights two rooks,
and eight pawns.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,930
So 12 different kinds.

12
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,720
When we come to identify a piece,

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,520
the first question
we might ask is,

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,170
is it black or white?

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:40,330
If we get the answer, say white,

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,080
then we're left with the
remaining six kinds.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,720
Distinguish between those.

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,370
We can start with the question,

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,039
Is it a pawn or not a pawn?

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,880
If it's pawn, we're then done,
and there is not a pawn,

21
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,380
we must then decide which of

22
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,410
the five different
kinds that there are here,

23
00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:01,985
we have an example of. These
are called the minor pieces,

24
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,515
the knights and the bishops.

25
00:01:03,515 --> 00:01:05,165
And these are the major pieces.

26
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:08,075
So if we ask, is
it major or minor,

27
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:11,060
then if we get this
answer that it's minor,

28
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,725
then it's either a
night or two Bishop.

29
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,915
So one more question,
will finish things.

30
00:01:14,915 --> 00:01:17,150
On the other hand, if
it's major than we

31
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,760
find it's either a
rock or a royal.

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,395
If it's a rook, we're finished.

33
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:24,575
But if it's a royal, we
must ask one more question.

34
00:01:24,575 --> 00:01:27,890
What we're going to do with
the decision tree is draw

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,620
a picture of that process.

36
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,915
Hello, I'm Michael Fourman.

37
00:01:38,915 --> 00:01:42,470
We're talking about trees
in the cost quite a lot.

38
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,660
So I thought I would
show you this tree

39
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,435
which is the great sycamore
in Birnam wood.

40
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:49,550
And as you can see,

41
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:53,810
it has roots which are hidden
and it has branches and it has leaves.

42
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:56,315
And we'll talk about
the way we have roots,

43
00:01:56,315 --> 00:01:59,645
branches, and leaves in our
trees in the next lecture.

44
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:02,870
Anyway, you should go
and visit Scotland,

45
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,910
and see all it's wonderful
things when you have

46
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,070
the chance to come here,
if you're not here,

47
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,510
you're missing a lot,
but I hope you're

48
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,400
enjoying yourself,
whatever you are.

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,685
Here's the picture.
We start here.

50
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:17,030
We ask is it a pawn if it
is, and that's fine.

51
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,880
And if it's not, then
we move to this point.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,360
This symbol here, we read as not.

53
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,740
So it's not a pawn.

54
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,450
We come here and we ask,

55
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,220
is it minor or major?

56
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,025
If it's minor, then
just as we said before,

57
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,540
we then have one more question to

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,180
determine whether it's
a bishop or a knight.

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,854
If it's major, we
have that question.

60
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,000
If it's a rook, we're done.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,470
And if it's a royal,

62
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,700
We have one more question to

63
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,010
determine if it's
a queen or king,

64
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,885
so that's very straightforward.

65
00:02:47,885 --> 00:02:50,990
We've introduced negation.

66
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,760
We've introduced the idea of

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,470
a tree which will
be very important.

68
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,290
This is the tree.
We call it a tree,

69
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,700
and we call this the root.

70
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,490
We grow our trees
upside down when

71
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,865
we come down here we're following
a branch of the tree.

72
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:07,235
And when we get to the end,

73
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:08,600
these things are called leaves.

74
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,670
So we have leaves here,

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,940
the root here, the

76
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,060
various branching
points we call nodes.

77
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,480
So a tree has nodes and
edges which are branches,

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,564
which form branches going
from the root. To the leaves.

79
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:30,275
If we now look at this tree,

80
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:32,854
instead of saying, Is
it minor or major,

81
00:03:32,854 --> 00:03:34,070
we can just ask yes,

82
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,395
no question in each
place so we can say,

83
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:38,915
is it not a pawn?

84
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:40,225
If it's not a pawn,

85
00:03:40,225 --> 00:03:41,480
we go this way.

86
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,105
If it is a pawn, and that's false,

87
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:47,285
that it's not a pawn.
We go this way.

88
00:03:47,285 --> 00:03:49,505
We ask, is it major?

89
00:03:49,505 --> 00:03:51,305
If it's major, we go this way.

90
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,790
If it's minor, in other words

91
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,560
not major, then we go this way.

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,960
So depending on whether
it's true or false,

93
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:00,630
we can go right or left.

94
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,905
Here, instead of asking,

95
00:04:03,905 --> 00:04:05,120
Is it a bishop or a knight,

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,590
we say, is it a knight?

97
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:08,915
If it is not that it
must be a bishop?

98
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,230
Reduce this decision to a number

99
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:16,640
of binary questions and in
fact to yes, no question.

100
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,200
The answers now are true
and false at each level.

101
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,415
And if we use 0 and 1 as codings
for true and false,

102
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:28,160
then we can use this
decision tree to give

103
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,414
a code for each kind of piece.

104
00:04:31,414 --> 00:04:33,605
If we start here, and we see a 0.

105
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:34,955
We go this way.

106
00:04:34,955 --> 00:04:38,510
We've got a pawn. If we
see a one, we go this way.

107
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,610
And then if we see
a 0 followed by

108
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,680
a 0, we've got a bishop.

109
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,530
So 1-0-0, takes us to a bishop.

110
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:49,475
1-0-1 takes us to a knight,

111
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:53,255
1-1-0 takes us to a rook,

112
00:04:53,255 --> 00:04:58,460
and 1-1-1-0 takes us to a queen,

113
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:03,635
and 1-1-1-1 takes us to the king.

114
00:05:03,635 --> 00:05:08,450
We can take the decision tree
and examine something else.

115
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,350
We can say, how many times
do we ask each question?

116
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,480
How many times do we
ask each question?

117
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,840
If we cover every single
piece in the box,

118
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,895
so we take all the white pieces,

119
00:05:19,895 --> 00:05:21,695
all 16 of them.

120
00:05:21,695 --> 00:05:24,710
For every one, we will
answer this question.

121
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,040
We'll ask, is it a pawn or not?

122
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,785
If it's not, there are
eight things which are not.

123
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:32,750
And we ask, are they
major or minor?

124
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,350
We divide those in two, the
minor and the major.

125
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:40,625
So we ask this question
for four, this question, for four.

126
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,475
After that, we've
determined these two,

127
00:05:43,475 --> 00:05:46,370
but we still ask
the question again.

128
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,305
If we get a royal,

129
00:05:48,305 --> 00:05:52,470
so twice we ask this
question, is it a king?

130
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:57,170
So there are eight things for
which you ask one question.

131
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:03,395
There are six things for
which we ask 1 2 3 questions.

132
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:08,930
And there are two things for
which we ask 1 2 3 4 questions.

133
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,715
We sum that up,

134
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,815
then we've got a total of 34.

135
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,020
And that's the same as
adding up the numbers

136
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,899
that I put inside these nodes.

137
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:21,905
So this is a code presented
as a decision tree.

138
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:28,610
It encodes each piece
as a series of bits,

139
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,490
which is either one bit 0,

140
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,280
or in these cases three bits,

141
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,830
or in this case, these
cases four bits.

142
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,095
It's a variable length encoding.

143
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,759
In the next video,

144
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:45,320
we'll look at alternative
encodings that don't require

145
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,720
so many questions to

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,420
determine whether
it's a king or queen.
