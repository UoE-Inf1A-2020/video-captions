1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,370
If we have a language that's

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:08,025
talking about four
different predicates,

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,020
then we can make a special model

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,050
which is a universal
model for that. Each region

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,780
in here corresponds to a
pattern like that which shows

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,690
us which of the four things
are true and which are false.

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,610
But if we're being
a bit more formal,

8
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:24,735
we can think of it as a
state which says a not b,

9
00:00:24,735 --> 00:00:29,505
not c and d. Where is this
true in this universe?

10
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:31,710
How many places is it true?

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:35,190
One. So if I write
a state like this,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,130
then it corresponds to
exactly one of these

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,895
and in this case, it's this one.

14
00:00:39,895 --> 00:00:43,505
We'll also think of these
states as valuations,

15
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:44,675
that is functions.

16
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,225
If we have a function
saying a is true,

17
00:00:47,225 --> 00:00:49,610
b is false, c is
false, d is true.

18
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:52,580
So that one model and
these two ideas of how

19
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,715
we may represent the regions
here will be very important.

20
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:57,710
So in this model, if I look at

21
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,375
the state that
satisfies a, not b, not c,

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:06,185
and d. And for those of you
who remember yesterday,

23
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:09,230
gamma on the left

24
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,665
here is just a set with
four things in it and

25
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:17,495
they're very simple. And when we
say gamma satisfies p,

26
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:23,750
what it means is p is satisfied
in the sub-thing of this,

27
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,180
the sub universe in which gamma,

28
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,940
everything in gamma is
true. That sub universe in

29
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,345
this case is the universe
that only has this one thing.

30
00:01:32,345 --> 00:01:34,880
This satisfies p if

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,310
and only if p holds
of that one thing.

32
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,220
So we've taken this
general idea we had

33
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,125
before and were able just to say:

34
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:44,180
oh, we work out p on this one,

35
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,905
and that tells me
whether this is true.

36
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,135
To tell whether this is,

37
00:01:47,135 --> 00:01:48,740
whether it's valid on this one,

38
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,920
we just substitute different
things here and work it out.

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,160
But what I want to do now
is to introduce the ways of

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,045
taking patterns on these 16
things and identifying them.

41
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:01,940
Here's a state picture
of the same thing.

42
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,120
Here we're thinking of
something which has a state

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,660
represented by four
lights. And they're amber,

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,600
green, red, blue. Amber is the name

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,230
of the yellow of a
traffic light in Britain.

46
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,985
So if you don't
know what amber is,

47
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:18,770
go out and look at one
of the traffic lights.

48
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,500
The yellow color on the
traffic light is not yellow,

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,330
it's amber. Look in the highway code.

50
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,030
So we're going to treat states
as lights. In this diagram,

51
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,090
it's a perfectly good Venn
diagram in that each region is

52
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,390
represented and no region
is represented twice.

53
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,580
But it's not a very nice diagram

54
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,860
because things aren't
very different.

55
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,370
Like this one is not very
different from this one.

56
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,755
It only differs by one light:

57
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:44,795
whether the amber
light is on or off.

58
00:02:44,795 --> 00:02:46,580
They're far apart. From this state,

59
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,710
the red and amber: to
switch off amber

60
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,925
we have to go a long way.

61
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:52,325
Another pattern, a Karnaugh map,

62
00:02:52,325 --> 00:02:54,185
puts things in a different order.

63
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,985
This is a bit of magic.

64
00:02:55,985 --> 00:02:57,920
Now, to change one light,

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,155
you just have to move
one square. If you

66
00:03:00,155 --> 00:03:03,170
go from one thing to the next,

67
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,820
we only change one light.

68
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Here, the amber light goes on.

69
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,965
And here the amber light goes on.

70
00:03:09,965 --> 00:03:11,450
The amber light goes on.

71
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,920
The amber light goes on.

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,635
Here, the green light goes off.

73
00:03:15,635 --> 00:03:17,060
The green light goes off.

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,515
The green light goes off.

75
00:03:18,515 --> 00:03:19,910
Green light goes off.

76
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,620
What happens if we come down here?

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,330
The blue light comes on.

78
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,950
Red light comes on.

79
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,795
Blue light goes off.

80
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:29,300
Red light goes off. What happens

81
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,670
when the amber light goes off?

82
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,850
When the amber light goes
off, you go from here,

83
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,845
you have to come back here.

84
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:42,680
So we'll come back to that
and see that picture again.

85
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,300
We won't need it
for a little while.

86
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,225
Here, we've got 'a' as a nice block.

87
00:03:47,225 --> 00:03:49,850
That's places where the
amber light is on.

88
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,730
We've got g as a nice block.

89
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,045
This word 'block' is actually
going to be a technical word.

90
00:03:56,045 --> 00:03:58,970
A 'block' on one of
these diagrams is

91
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:02,150
one of the rectangles I am
going to be showing you.

92
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,535
And I want you to think about

93
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,460
what's special about these
rectangles we're seeing.

94
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,690
So we'll see a variety of

95
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,150
them and we will come
to the definition,

96
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,470
but I'd like you to
think about what's

97
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,465
special about the
rectangles we're showing

98
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:16,700
and we haven't shown
sufficient variety

99
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,845
yet for me to ask
you the question.

100
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:23,465
The reds and the blues are there.

101
00:04:23,465 --> 00:04:26,285
So if we know where amber,
green, red, blue are,

102
00:04:26,285 --> 00:04:28,730
we can work out where not b is.

103
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,200
Not b is the things outside here.

104
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,105
You know, it's a bit like
a Venn diagram except

105
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,280
instead of having the
thing with everything off

106
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,465
sitting out in the cold,

107
00:04:35,465 --> 00:04:37,130
it's rather the same
as everything else:

108
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:38,855
it's just another
thing in our diagram.

109
00:04:38,855 --> 00:04:41,105
Another way of looking at this

110
00:04:41,105 --> 00:04:43,925
is to take exactly the
diagram we had before,

111
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:47,180
but now for amber and
green, I'm saying 00,

112
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,390
meaning amber and green are all
off down in this column.

113
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,315
01 means amber is
off and green is on.

114
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:54,980
Check it in this column.

115
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,785
Here, amber and green are both on. And here,

116
00:04:57,785 --> 00:05:02,690
amber is on but green is off.
Notice the order: I don't go

117
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:11,450
00-01-10-11 counting in
binary, I go 00-01-11-10.

118
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,420
And that's called a Huffman code.

119
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,550
So it only changes by

120
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,610
one bit when you go from
one place to the next.

121
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,280
And you can do those
with any number of bits.

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,765
So if you have a 5-bit number,

123
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:25,955
You can write something
that does this.

124
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:27,500
And when we come here,

125
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,940
if we go back to the beginning,

126
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,335
we still only change one bit.

127
00:05:30,335 --> 00:05:32,645
So we use the same
code going down here.

128
00:05:32,645 --> 00:05:34,190
And again, if we come
back to the beginning,

129
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,525
we only change one bit.

130
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,640
But this time, here we're saying

131
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,830
that red and blue are off. Here

132
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,560
we're saying that red is off,
blue is on. Here

133
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,940
we're saying they're both on.

134
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:46,330
And here we're saying red is
on, but blue is off.

135
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,050
So that does all the possibilities.

136
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,450
Now what we want to do is do
a little bit of logic.
