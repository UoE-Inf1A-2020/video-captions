1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,265
Do the first bit for you.

2
00:00:02,265 --> 00:00:04,740
We've got the hypotheses.

3
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,230
Some C is not a,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,735
so this is inhabited.

5
00:00:09,735 --> 00:00:13,110
And sum C is not

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:18,700
p. So your question
is, does this follow?

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,015
If it doesn't follow,

8
00:00:23,015 --> 00:00:24,920
what could we find?

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,410
How can we show that
it doesn't follow?

10
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,390
It doesn't follow.

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,860
That means that there's

12
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,530
some Universe in which
we've interpreted a,

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,020
B, and C as predicates.

14
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,225
So there's some
collection of things.

15
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:44,405
Then there are three
subsets of that collection.

16
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:49,235
And they satisfy the
premises of this rule,

17
00:00:49,235 --> 00:00:52,550
but they don't satisfy
the conclusion.

18
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,230
Now we start to discover

19
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,510
something interesting
about these models.

20
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,250
I want to make a model,

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,970
and I'm only talking
about three predicates,

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,755
then there are really

23
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,115
only a few kinds of things
that I can contemplate.

24
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:09,965
That could be something in
here or they could know.

25
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:11,525
There could be something in here.

26
00:01:11,525 --> 00:01:14,330
Or they could know
or here, or here,

27
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,590
or here, or here,

28
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,240
or all the way out here.

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,855
How many possible kinds
of thing are there?

30
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:22,670
When I'm just talking
about whether

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,775
their flowers, fungi, or plants.

32
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,695
There's the only things
I can say about them.

33
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:29,150
We'll say that things

34
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,980
which don't differ
in that way we'll

35
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,500
count is the same for
the moment because

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,415
I've got an example
of one of them.

37
00:01:34,415 --> 00:01:36,230
Or I haven't any examples
doesn't matter if

38
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,165
I got 20 examples or one.

39
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,499
For this purpose.

40
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,210
We're just interested
whether there is

41
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,505
something in there,
nothing in there.

42
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:47,250
How many different kinds
of thing might I think of?

43
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,045
Who think seven.

44
00:01:50,045 --> 00:01:55,070
Any advance on 78, y eight,

45
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,575
if I think of is there's an,

46
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,545
a two possibilities, yes or no.

47
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:03,395
Is this a pay another
two possibilities.

48
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:06,200
So altogether there's four
possibilities for the ice.

49
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,615
And please, let me have C,

50
00:02:08,615 --> 00:02:10,760
two possibilities for
each of these four.

51
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,530
I can have one that
has or doesn't

52
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,405
have C. So that's
coupling it again.

53
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,835
So it's two cubed is eight.

54
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:21,050
And in general, if I had
n propositional letters,

55
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,560
there will be two to the
power n kinds of thing.

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,845
So when we're looking
for a model here,

57
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:30,470
what we're really
doing is saying,

58
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,770
which of these things
have something in them,

59
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,520
which go to make your model
checking for the moment.

60
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,020
Let's try and make a model with

61
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,940
as many kinds of things as

62
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,830
possible that still
makes this fall.

63
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:51,180
So let's say I don't want
to put anything in here.

64
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,260
So I won't put anything in there.

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,300
I will put something in here.

66
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,670
For all these other white ones.

67
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,800
I could put something in or not.

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,620
It would still make
the premises are true,

69
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,980
and it would still make
the conclusion false.

70
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,750
We have to put one in there to

71
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,145
make this conclusion false.

72
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,390
And that would be enough. But it

73
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,010
feels like a very strange model.

74
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,890
But we can put in all of

75
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,915
those and still make
this conclusion false.

76
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,570
So that's the largest
model we could make

77
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,635
that satisfies the premises.

78
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:33,860
But doesn't satisfy
the conclusion.

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,115
This is empty because
if the assumption,

80
00:03:37,115 --> 00:03:41,330
this is empty because

81
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:43,250
we're trying to make it
so that C does satisfy B.

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,750
To show that this
thing isn't true.
