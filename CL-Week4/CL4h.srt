1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,905
Now we have these rules,

2
00:00:01,905 --> 00:00:06,210
and these rules are
valid in any universe.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,725
Fluid, in some universe,

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:10,695
I add gammas and deltas,

5
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,410
basically everywhere, the
same gamma everywhere on

6
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,860
the left and the same delta
everywhere on the right.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,880
If I put a gamma here,

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,405
gamma here, a delta there,

9
00:00:23,405 --> 00:00:25,685
and a delta there,

10
00:00:25,685 --> 00:00:29,930
that I'm saying that that
rule that is only there in

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:33,935
black is valid in the universe

12
00:00:33,935 --> 00:00:37,790
where everything in
gamma is true and

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,734
everything in delta is false,
that's another universe.

14
00:00:41,734 --> 00:00:44,885
And this rule is valid
in all universes.

15
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:46,760
So that's certainly the case.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,080
So if I have any one of

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,000
my rules that we've
already written

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,830
down and I decorate it

19
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,125
with these extra
gammas and deltas.

20
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,300
I'm really not saying
anything different.

21
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,980
I'm just saying in
these particular

22
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,245
places that rule holds.

23
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:05,330
So these roles are valid
because now this is saying

24
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,820
that if this holds
in that universe,

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,100
of that part of the
universe where every gamma

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,665
is true and everything
and delta is false,

27
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:18,830
then this happens in that
part of the universe.

28
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,555
So I put the gammas
and deltas here.

29
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:23,780
If we write the rules without
the gammas and deltas,

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,610
provided they sound, we can add

31
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,040
the gammas and deltas
and they still sound.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,590
So we add them. This is

33
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,810
the form in which you
will normally see

34
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,580
these rules learned to love

35
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,465
them to the end or all
rules which are here.

36
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,725
I've added one which
is the immediate rule.

37
00:01:42,725 --> 00:01:46,295
I normally draw that with
a single line on top.

38
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,590
That doesn't mean it
doesn't go both ways.

39
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,720
It just means that actually you

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,165
don't need anything
on top to come down.

41
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,150
This rule says, it is

42
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:59,839
always the case if a
occurs on both sides.

43
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:03,650
Remember, the sequence is valid.

44
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,875
If when I make
everything here true,

45
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,205
then I make something here true.

46
00:02:10,205 --> 00:02:11,420
If I make everything here true,

47
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,130
I make a true and a is here.

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,390
So I've made something
that troops.

49
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,255
So that's, that's
trivially it's immediate.

50
00:02:17,255 --> 00:02:19,160
That's the eye. It's
an immediate rule.

51
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,255
We just write it down.

52
00:02:20,255 --> 00:02:22,670
And if we ever want to know why

53
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,430
that's true or say,
why is that true?

54
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,620
We put a line with nothing
above it to say it's

55
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,620
true because from
nothing I can get that.

56
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,005
Whereas these rules, if I
have this valid somewhere,

57
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:38,570
then I have this and vice versa.

58
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,190
That's what the
double line means.

59
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,720
We never need to use this one

60
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,055
backward because it would say,

61
00:02:43,055 --> 00:02:46,385
if I know the I satisfies a,

62
00:02:46,385 --> 00:02:48,050
then I would know that true.

63
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,445
Well, that's a bit useless.

64
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:52,595
Whereas here it says,
if I know that gamma

65
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:56,599
satisfies a and B or Delta,

66
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,255
and think of that
cameras and all.

67
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,980
Then I know that,

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,540
and I know this,

69
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,010
and I know that.

70
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,000
So these rules say
if everything above

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,400
the line is valid

72
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,115
in some universe than
in the same universe,

73
00:03:13,115 --> 00:03:15,335
the thing below
the line is valid.

74
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:19,130
The other thing is, these
are formerly finite sets.

75
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,620
So really, I should write this as

76
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,390
the set delta together with
the singleton a and B.

77
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,910
But if we get too many
brackets all over

78
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,410
the place and it's
much easier just to

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,270
know that assets in our head.

80
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,580
So it doesn't matter what order
we write things in and it

81
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:37,175
doesn't matter how many
times I duplicate something,

82
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:40,940
but I'll write them
just as lists.

83
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,120
Commerce, I got a negation
rule down the bottom.

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,245
The assumption says, if
everything gamma is true,

85
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:50,540
then either a is
true or something

86
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,040
adultery is true
because something

87
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,540
in this list altogether,

88
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,105
this is set on the right
altogether is true.

89
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,345
So either it's a or it's
something that's in delta.

90
00:03:59,345 --> 00:04:05,465
This says, if I've made a
false and I know gamma,

91
00:04:05,465 --> 00:04:06,830
then I know something
intelligible.

92
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,500
If I've made a false
and I know gamma,

93
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,880
then it can't be a, That's true.

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,050
So it must be something in delta.

95
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,280
That's how that rule works.
