1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,955
What happens if some
of them are negated?

2
00:00:02,955 --> 00:00:06,150
So suppose I have some of
these that have a NOT on them.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,875
But what does that
valuation mean?

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:10,170
It makes S true.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,240
It makes Q false.

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,860
What does it do to our,

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,809
makes not our true.

8
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,325
So it makes our false.

9
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,175
Similarly, it makes not P false.

10
00:00:20,175 --> 00:00:22,360
So it makes Pete True.

11
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,420
Everyone understand how
we read the valuation

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,180
of the literals that we're
making true and they're above,

13
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,230
and the literals that we're

14
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,580
making false when they're below.

15
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,170
So if it's a negated literal,

16
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,480
then it makes an
atom the opposite.

17
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,615
What happens if I
repeat something?

18
00:00:38,615 --> 00:00:41,105
So here I've got not p

19
00:00:41,105 --> 00:00:44,840
and p. Now as well
as the rule says,

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,530
you must always cross an arrow
going upwards, or sorry,

21
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,670
crystalline, an arrow must

22
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,995
always cross the
line going upwards.

23
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:53,390
We've also got the rule,

24
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,800
when I have a valuation,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,070
I've gotta put not something on

26
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,985
the other side from our
something's whereby put a true,

27
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:03,815
there has to be false.

28
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:07,295
I make a false that
nasa has to be true.

29
00:01:07,295 --> 00:01:10,520
So if they both occur,

30
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,280
and there I've got
a p and a not pay,

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,230
any legal line has to go

32
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,350
between p and not pay
for this problem.

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,790
Instead of having all

34
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,130
five of the lines
that we had before

35
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,600
for the earlier
problem that look the

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,940
same but didn't have
the p repeated.

37
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,890
We have to go between
the p and not

38
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,350
p. This is a consequence
of something

39
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,450
called ps is r2 NOT P

40
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:35,735
implies P of I have an
arrow from NOT P to P,

41
00:01:35,735 --> 00:01:38,645
then I have to draw the
line between these two.

42
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:40,220
Therefore, p must be true.

43
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,710
What happens now
here's an example.

44
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:47,060
R implies Q and R
implies S. So I draw

45
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,590
the diagram and I can

46
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,145
certainly make this true
by drawing this line.

47
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,965
If I make all of
our Q and S false,

48
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:57,020
then because the
implications are true

49
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,345
when both their
arguments are false,

50
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:00,995
this lines perfectly fine.

51
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,515
How many other lines can we draw?

52
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,590
The lines don't have to be
horizontal, latent be wiggly.

53
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:09,500
They've just got to cut
the arrows the right way.

54
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,760
So each line has a,

55
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,380
a red side and the
green side that

56
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,180
we don't normally draw
them in red and green.

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,680
We don't have red
and green pencils.

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,880
It just to make you think of

59
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,875
the two sides, draw the line.

60
00:02:18,875 --> 00:02:20,300
And it's got a side
that's below it,

61
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,530
an aside that's above it.

62
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,030
And we've got to cross so that

63
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,475
the below side has the
tales of any arrows,

64
00:02:25,475 --> 00:02:27,605
and the above side has
the heads of the arrows.

65
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,350
Where else can I draw a
line? I've drawn one?

66
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,880
Can you draw for more?

67
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,495
We can come here in here and
we can go straight across.

68
00:02:35,495 --> 00:02:38,270
But we can also come in
here and go down there.

69
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,985
We can come in here and
go straight across.

70
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,550
But we can also come
in here and go there.

71
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,380
And we can also go across here.

72
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,195
Helpful sometimes.

73
00:02:47,195 --> 00:02:49,670
When things get more
complicated to count,

74
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,050
how many ways are there of

75
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:52,820
coming from here towards there.

76
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,245
This is a different
kind of arrow.

77
00:02:54,245 --> 00:02:55,610
This is, I'm coming from here,

78
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,575
coming from here. How
many ways there is?

79
00:02:57,575 --> 00:02:59,720
One way I can get to
that line because I've

80
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,000
just started as one way
I get to that line.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,380
But once I'm in here,

82
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,870
there are two ways I
could have gotten here.

83
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,070
So when I came out, there were

84
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,600
two ways I could get there.

85
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,465
In two ways I could get the
here, there's just one.

86
00:03:11,465 --> 00:03:13,580
So down here I can
count two plus two

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,980
plus one is five altogether.

88
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,945
Sometimes helpful
just to keep tally.

89
00:03:17,945 --> 00:03:22,230
This is just going through
those various valuations.

90
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,855
What do we do now?

91
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,940
So I want you to work out

92
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,670
how many ways there are of

93
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,745
drawing a line there that
satisfies the rules.

94
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:41,030
First cheque, do we have
any repeated atoms?

95
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,470
In other words, do we have, well,

96
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,500
either something repeated,
in which case they both,

97
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,690
if I have a and a has
gotta be the same,

98
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,640
same side of the line if
you've written it twice,

99
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,245
but I would advise
not doing that.

100
00:03:51,245 --> 00:03:52,880
Link it together instead.

101
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,090
But do we have an a and not
a or an hour not on them.

102
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:58,370
So we can just go ahead
and count the lines.

103
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,305
We don't have to worry
about the second rule.

104
00:04:00,305 --> 00:04:03,260
If we draw one's coming in there,

105
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:08,360
11111, what number
am I going to put?

106
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,820
What number am I
going to put here?

107
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,970
Last time we looked at
an example where there

108
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,220
were two ways of coming
in on this side.

109
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,230
So we put a two on those

110
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,765
because there were two ways
we could have got here,

111
00:04:20,765 --> 00:04:22,745
but now there are three
ways of getting in.

112
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,410
So now we will put a three

113
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,900
here and three here,
and three here.

114
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,940
Now we just count the
ways we can get out

115
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,550
altogether one way
here, three there,

116
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,380
because they count
for the three ways

117
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,330
we could have come
in, going out there,

118
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,530
three here because they count

119
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,730
for the three ways
we could have come

120
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,140
in getting out there

121
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,910
and three here because
of the three ways.

122
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:43,445
So in total, how many do we have?

123
00:04:43,445 --> 00:04:44,945
I've got one at the top,

124
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:46,790
one at the bottom, and
three times three.

125
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:49,370
So I've got 11, that's
the one at the top here,

126
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,205
the three, the 331 at the bottom.

127
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:54,050
We can come through here and just

128
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,885
make all of these literals true.

129
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,735
Or we can go through the top
and make all of them false,

130
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:01,190
or we split them up.

131
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,500
And there are three ways that

132
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,125
make you not P false and Q true.

133
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:09,035
There are three ways
that make Q false,

134
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,120
not are true, and there are

135
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,105
three ways that may not
have false and true.

136
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,100
So I put one on each of

137
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,230
these places I can
get into the diagram.

138
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,400
If I'm in this region,

139
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,245
I had three ways
of getting there.

140
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:23,300
Through here, through
here, through here.

141
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,120
So on the ways I get
out of that region,

142
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,875
I label them each with a three.

143
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:30,080
Because the number
of lines that get

144
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,360
to here could be that one,

145
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,845
that one, or that one.

146
00:05:33,845 --> 00:05:35,360
And the number of
lines to get to here

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,845
could be that one, that one,

148
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:39,500
or that one number here
could be that one,

149
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,700
that one or that one.

150
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,395
So that's why I've got a
three on each of these.

151
00:05:42,395 --> 00:05:43,910
I've still got the possibility of

152
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,920
this line which is
that one there,

153
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,930
and this line which
is that one there.

154
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,275
So these two accounted separately
and then we got three.

155
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:55,145
We got three plus three
plus three to give us 11.

156
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,645
You will get practise on this.

157
00:05:56,645 --> 00:05:59,120
It can be very confusing
if you just try and draw

158
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,540
the lines that some
lines drawn on it.

159
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,210
Do we have 11123456?

160
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,935
I think we don't have 11.

161
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:11,210
Which one's missing?

162
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:13,010
It's much easier to do

163
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,785
the counting them to
dry and draw the lines.

164
00:06:15,785 --> 00:06:18,620
The hint of what's missing is we

165
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,635
know that there should
be three ways of,

166
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:23,420
three ways of coming out here.

167
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,115
So we only have two,

168
00:06:25,115 --> 00:06:28,250
so that one's missing and
that one's missing amino,

169
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,450
there should be three coming out

170
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,115
here, so that one's missing.

171
00:06:31,115 --> 00:06:34,280
And I think then we've
got all the lines.

172
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,015
But the counting, except in
the simplest cases is easier.

173
00:06:38,015 --> 00:06:40,190
The other way of
thinking about it

174
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,470
is the other way of
thinking about it.

175
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,720
The other way of thinking
about it is I have

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,800
three ways of getting in

177
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,140
here and three ways
of coming out here.

178
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,580
So I've got three times,

179
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,385
three ways of going
through here altogether.

180
00:06:52,385 --> 00:06:55,370
Okay, that's also a way of
thinking about it which works.

181
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,840
But you want a single
block like this,

182
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:01,200
but we'll see examples soon
where that's more difficult.
