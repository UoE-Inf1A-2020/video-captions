1
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,455
Let's just think a
bit about things.

2
00:00:35,455 --> 00:00:37,840
We're going to look
at collections of

3
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,120
things to keep it simple.

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,310
We're going to look at
finite collections of

5
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,185
things and things
have properties.

6
00:00:45,185 --> 00:00:48,170
So here we've got some cosmetics.

7
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,970
One of the important properties

8
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,410
of cosmetics is that colour.

9
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,975
There will be plenty of
other important properties.

10
00:00:53,975 --> 00:00:55,910
We have some tools,

11
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,790
these tools that
dimensions are going to be

12
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,895
very important and
maybe their weight.

13
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:04,310
These crayons, well,
color's important,

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,234
but again, there are other
properties that are important.

15
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:11,059
This crockery, the
wake, is important.

16
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:12,890
The look of them is important.

17
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,380
The other examples
on this page are

18
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,870
examples of games in
one way or another.

19
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,255
Here we have a croquet set,

20
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:25,415
a set of weights for
exercising models,

21
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:29,315
mythical beasts, and a chess set.

22
00:01:29,315 --> 00:01:30,845
I want to talk a little bit

23
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:32,480
about these different
kinds of gaining,

24
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,935
the Cronkite said, as
balls and mallets.

25
00:01:36,935 --> 00:01:40,250
And it's important
that the balls have

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,694
their particular
dimensions and weights

27
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:45,590
that the hoop sat there
particular dimensions.

28
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,439
It's important that
the mallets or true

29
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:53,645
and have flat faces with
which to hit the balls.

30
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,870
For the weights, the
weights are important,

31
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,049
the dimensions of the
bars important for these,

32
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,750
the physical properties are

33
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,855
really essential to these items.

34
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,819
If I now coming here,

35
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:10,475
the mythical beasts are
somewhat different.

36
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:14,435
They representations of
things that don't exist.

37
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:17,285
So here we have a flying horse.

38
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:21,110
And I can ask you questions
about the flying horse,

39
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,685
how many witnesses attack?

40
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,374
And you can look and
count the wings.

41
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:28,760
But if I ask you,

42
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,270
what's its blood temperature?

43
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,085
You're gonna get me a Scotland's.

44
00:02:34,085 --> 00:02:37,790
Well, it doesn't have blood.

45
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,130
The model doesn't have blood.

46
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,260
Actually the mythical horse does,

47
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,855
because a mythical horse
can bleed to death,

48
00:02:44,855 --> 00:02:47,720
but its temperature
doesn't make sense.

49
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,030
These mythical beasts,

50
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:53,180
you have the properties
that we ascribe to them.

51
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,865
Or at least the myth
makers ascribe to them.

52
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,950
They have those properties
and it doesn't make

53
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,739
sense to ask about
other properties.

54
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:08,630
Strangely, this bird has
red and orange wings.

55
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,610
So this is a mythical beast with

56
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:15,620
a physical representation
of the color of its wings.

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,110
And it's a physical
representation

58
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:21,275
of the color that only
exists in a myth.

59
00:03:21,275 --> 00:03:22,970
And we can recognize it

60
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,295
because we know what
red looks like.

61
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:30,125
The chess set is in some
ways the most interesting.

62
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:32,295
The chess pieces.

63
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:39,775
Represent individual
capabilities.

64
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:42,085
So the way that
the king can move,

65
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:43,870
the way that the queen can move,

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:47,095
the ways they can
take other pieces,

67
00:03:47,095 --> 00:03:50,545
the actions they can take differ.

68
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:53,965
And there's no representation of

69
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:58,360
those properties directly in
the way they are modeled.

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,730
And we could model them
quite differently and

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,535
still recognize this
as a chess set.

72
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,760
They do have laws that

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,530
govern the ways they may move

74
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,840
on the board and the
things they can do.

75
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,700
Do we need a board to play chess?

76
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,080
While some people down, there are

77
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,915
people who can play
testing their heads.

78
00:04:17,915 --> 00:04:20,810
And certainly a computer

79
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,920
can play chess without
the Jess said.

80
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,985
In some sense, it
plays virtually.

81
00:04:28,985 --> 00:04:32,210
So what is logic?

82
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,680
Logic has something in
common with this example.

83
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,635
On something in common
with this example,

84
00:04:39,635 --> 00:04:43,070
less in common with
the weights on the CR.

85
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,430
Okay? In the case of
the mythical beasts,

86
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,230
we have mythical creatures
which exist only

87
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,690
virtually and which
have the properties

88
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,390
that the myth makers
of given them.

89
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,685
And then we'd make
a physical model.

90
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:03,190
In logic, we often take

91
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,940
a physical situation and
then we abstract from

92
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,985
that physical situation and make

93
00:05:09,985 --> 00:05:12,160
virtual things or mythical things

94
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,765
if you want to put it that way,

95
00:05:13,765 --> 00:05:17,770
which had only the properties
that we've focused on.

96
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,425
And we ignore all the
other properties.

97
00:05:20,425 --> 00:05:24,445
And now we reason about
those properties in

98
00:05:24,445 --> 00:05:26,710
just the same way as we would

99
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,720
reason about the properties
of the mythical beasts.

100
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,180
Logic also has something in

101
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,870
common with the chess example.

102
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,750
Because as well as
modeling properties

103
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,010
of some abstract things that
only have those properties,

104
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:51,425
we can model the capabilities
of those things,

105
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:53,495
the ways they can interact,

106
00:05:53,495 --> 00:05:56,960
the ways they can move
on a virtual board.

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,150
But instead of it
being a virtual board,

108
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,305
we can make a model that
follows some rules,

109
00:06:03,305 --> 00:06:05,300
rather like the rules of chess.

110
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,540
A reason about the real world

111
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,755
by actually reasoning
about the model.

112
00:06:12,755 --> 00:06:17,330
In this video, we've
introduced the discussion of

113
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,460
the relationship between
logic, models and reality.

114
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:26,134
In the case of the mythical
beasts and the class pieces,

115
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:29,540
we have some ideas
of properties of

116
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,010
the bees or capabilities
of the chess pieces.

117
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,410
And we use physical marbles
to represent those.

118
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,980
And to help us to visualize
the mythical beasts and

119
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,045
the abstract capabilities
of the chess pieces.

120
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:49,910
What we're going to
go with logic is to

121
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,835
get a language that
allows us to take

122
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:58,865
real situations and create
virtual situations.

123
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:01,909
That model. Some of
their properties.

124
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:03,830
If we choose the properties we

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,780
model appropriately, we can,

126
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,460
we can make our models both

127
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,250
tractable in the
sense that we can

128
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,410
use computers to play games
represented by those models.

129
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,125
And applicable in the sense that

130
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,675
the results of those games

131
00:07:20,675 --> 00:07:23,810
were mirrored in the real world.

132
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,090
You can use chess as

133
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,955
a metaphor to try
and understand this.

134
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,995
Logic allows us to convert

135
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:35,105
many real-world problems
into gains a bit like chess,

136
00:07:35,105 --> 00:07:36,920
we use symbols to replace

137
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,630
the various entities involved

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,865
and describe their interactions.

139
00:07:40,865 --> 00:07:46,760
And computers play these
games to solve real problems.

140
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,045
We'll also use computers
to help us do logic.

141
00:07:50,045 --> 00:07:51,740
You don't need a computer,

142
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,600
but the computer can
help you to learn

143
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,805
logic just as a chessboard.

144
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:59,450
Even a virtual chess board
can help you to learn chess.

145
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,110
So we'll be using Haskell
to help you learn logic.

146
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:09,780
Really. Yeah.
