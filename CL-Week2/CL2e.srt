1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
In an earlier video,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,595
we ended with the remark that

3
00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:12,750
this syllogism is really
just an instance of Barbara,

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,745
where I put Nazi instead
of the sea in Barbara.

5
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:20,519
But since Barbara works
for any predicate,

6
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:22,800
it works for the predicate Nazi,

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,465
just as well as for
the predicate si.

8
00:00:25,465 --> 00:00:28,865
Here's an example
of that syllogism.

9
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:31,790
All snakes are reptiles.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,595
No reptile has for no snake has.

11
00:00:37,595 --> 00:00:42,620
We've taken our
syllogism Barbara,

12
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,305
since it works for
any predicates ABC,

13
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,700
it works for a, b,

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,955
and not c. So this rule
must also be sound.

15
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:53,000
If I look at it on
an oil a diagram.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,450
Then this says that
if a is contained in

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:02,554
B and B is disjoint from C,

18
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:06,620
then a is disjoint
from C. We can see

19
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,910
that intuitively obvious with
our geometric intuition,

20
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,340
but it looks like quite
a different observation

21
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,620
than the one about
a contained in B,

22
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,114
contained in C. It's a
different kind of thought.

23
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:22,955
When we represent it
with the Venn diagrams,

24
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:24,830
the derivation is very

25
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,155
similar to the one
we gave for Barbara.

26
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:30,650
If every a is b and
every B is Nazi,

27
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:32,434
than every a is Nazi.

28
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:34,970
Rephrasing that we
have if every a is

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,150
b and no BSC and no ASE.

30
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,660
And the example, all
snakes are reptiles,

31
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,570
no reptiles have
no snakes heifer.

32
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,590
In terms of the Euler diagrams,

33
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,860
all a's b looks like this.

34
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,665
This region in the
Venn diagram is empty,

35
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:02,815
and no a is B, looks like this.

36
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:06,985
And this region in the
Venn diagram is empty.

37
00:02:06,985 --> 00:02:09,100
If we now try and
prove this by putting

38
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,694
those together in the
way we did for Barbara.

39
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:15,580
We take this Venn
diagram for all a's b.

40
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,480
This Venn diagram for no BSC,

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,455
with these regions x
and y being empty,

42
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:27,280
we can put them together in

43
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,115
a three predicate Venn diagram

44
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:33,340
to know that all of
these parts are empty.

45
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,460
And we wanted to
show that no a is c,

46
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,520
that simply to show that
this region Zed is empty,

47
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,229
but just as we did before,

48
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:45,370
Zed is contained in X union Y,

49
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,160
Zed is contained
here in X union Y.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,870
So we can give that kind of

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,485
derivation problem,
the Euler diagram.

52
00:02:53,485 --> 00:02:55,735
It's much harder to see.

53
00:02:55,735 --> 00:03:00,625
So far we've seen two syllogisms.

54
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,710
The first one Barbara,

55
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,045
and the second one,

56
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:05,740
an instance of Barbara.

57
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,420
We saw that we could justify

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,625
back inference independently.

59
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:14,200
We're going to derive many
more syllogisms from Barbara.

60
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,225
From Barbara.

61
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:19,660
We derive this
syllogism simply by

62
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,170
substituting Nazi for c in here.

63
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,930
Here we're going to see
that with no more work,

64
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,585
we can get three more syllogisms.

65
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:36,385
We know that no B is C is
equivalent to know CSP.

66
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:40,165
So we can replace,
in this syllogism,

67
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:44,935
we replace the no
b is c by no CSB.

68
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:49,555
That is, we apply contraposition
to this proposition.

69
00:03:49,555 --> 00:03:52,870
That gives us a new syllogism,

70
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,165
which has this swapped over.

71
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:59,890
We can now swap this over to
give a new syllogism here.

72
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,280
And we can swap
this back again to

73
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,150
give yet another
new syllogism here.

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,949
So from this one,

75
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,170
we have derived for
others and we don't

76
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,675
need to check them
with Venn diagrams.

77
00:04:13,675 --> 00:04:15,190
You could as an exercise,

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,885
check them with Venn diagrams,

79
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:18,505
but we don't need to.

80
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:22,585
Because we've seen that
this is equivalent to this,

81
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,340
this is equivalent to this,

82
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,260
and this is equivalent to this.

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,300
All of these three syllogisms are

84
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,030
sound simply because this one is,

85
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,770
and this one is simply

86
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,725
because it's an
instance of this one.

87
00:04:35,725 --> 00:04:41,455
Logic is just common
sense in symbolic form.

88
00:04:41,455 --> 00:04:43,750
But it's quite hard to do

89
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,535
these transformations
without symbolic form.

90
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:50,995
You have to be Aristotle

91
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,545
to have thought of this
in the first place.

92
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:56,830
But with the algebra
notation we now have,

93
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,245
You can all do at
least as well as

94
00:04:59,245 --> 00:05:03,500
Aristotle in understanding
the syllogisms.

95
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,340
To see what we've achieved.

96
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,645
Take a look at these examples
of our five syllogisms.

97
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,065
If you had to just justify

98
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:17,650
these arguments without having

99
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,965
done this work at
the symbolic level.

100
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:23,930
I think you'll find it
much more difficult.
