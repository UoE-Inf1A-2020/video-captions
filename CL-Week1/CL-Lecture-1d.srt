00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:06,690
Hello. In this video,

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,520
we're going to look
at the universe.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,085
It's a very small universe,

4
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:13,650
not like Tommy's universe,

5
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,495
which had the Earth is the center

6
00:00:15,495 --> 00:00:17,130
that we're not going
to have the earth,

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,015
we just have a few
imaginary things.

8
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:24,960
Here's our universe, red, blue,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,980
an NBA, triangles and
desks, which are small.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,655
And some which a
launch nine things.

11
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:40,170
So here we have the
small blue triangle.

12
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:46,620
And here we have
a big Amber disc.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,730
Here we have some
statements we wanted

14
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:51,455
to make about these things,

15
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:53,075
some of which will be true

16
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,174
and some of which will be false.

17
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:58,430
Every red triangle is small.

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,475
Is that true or false?

19
00:01:01,475 --> 00:01:04,295
Every small triangle is read.

20
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:07,039
Is that true or false?

21
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:11,445
Some big triangle is amber.

22
00:01:11,445 --> 00:01:15,205
Some small disk is read.

23
00:01:15,205 --> 00:01:18,860
No red thing is blue.

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:25,120
I want you to work out which
of these statements is true,

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,270
which is false, shouldn't
take you very long.

26
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:32,980
Every red triangle is
small. What do we do?

27
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,785
We find the red triangles
and we see that

28
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:39,699
this one is small and that's
the only red triangle.

29
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:44,030
So every red triangle is small.

30
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,330
Every small triangle
is red, is not true.

31
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,160
How can we see that?
Because we can

32
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:54,390
produce a small triangle.

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,390
She's not read. And we go on
similarly with the others.

34
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,700
I'll leave you with those
questions for the moment.

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,880
And we'll return to this
problem in the next video.

36
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,510
What I want you to do
in the meantime is

37
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,440
to work out the answers
to these questions,

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,645
but also to try and think.

39
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:25,730
What's the general way of
explaining those answers?

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,970
How can we explain
what it means for each

41
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:33,360
of these statements
to be true or false?
